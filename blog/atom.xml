                                &lt;p&gt;So if you have been following this (let&amp;#8217;s assume you haven&amp;#8217;t) - this blog has been multi-functional. It has followed me from a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;UT&lt;/span&gt;-mini term study abroad in Accra, Ghana, to a summer internship in Kigali, Rwanda, to a class blog writing assignment. Now it will transition for yet another purpose - I will be studying abroad in Cochabamba, Bolivia, for an entire semester - and I hope to periodically update this for those interested in my journey. As I have in the past, I will very likely take excerpts from my journal and streamline it for these posts. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I of course encourage a wide readership (and posted questions, comments, concerns (if necessary)). I look forward to using this as one of the only means of discourse available to me from Cochabamba - that and of course, skype. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Excited and nervous, &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jac&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-4936348229887692956?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Hey, don&amp;#8217;t knock masturbation. It&amp;#8217;s sex with someone I love.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ALVY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SINGER&lt;/span&gt; (Woody Allen) in Annie Hall (1977)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I do not even know where to start with this post…&lt;br /&gt;We read a case investigated by the Inquisition, as it relates to heresy, with regards to a beata named Marina de San Miguel. Now, one of the major reasons for reading this article was to understand the procedural dichotomy used by the investigators and notaries, for the purpose of analyzing what formula was followed during such trials and how they were interpreted by the notaries. So let us skim through this first. Jacqueline Holler informs us that notaries did not transcribe the procedures verbatim, rather, they more often than note were a summary of what the accused had said; especially when the accused repeated a culturally used phrase or quote (i.e. scripture from the Bible). Holler does point out, however, that the records are very specific and personal, given their empirical inclination. She then explains the standard formula in succession, as it relates to procedural flow of a typical inquisition trial. I did find it highly unusual that in a trial of such magnitude, the defendant was allowed counsel; even if they had been appointed through the court itself. &lt;br /&gt;What makes Holler’s argument so interesting is the case she chose to examine. Marina was a fifty-three year old woman, living as a beata in Mexico, circa1598. Beata’s were less formal version of nuns, giving themselves a position socially that was acceptable, but also establishing a nun’s life without the restrictions of living in a monastery. Through her testimony, we are able to establish that she belonged to the Dominican order and her occupation was as a needle worker and she owns her own home; thus reflecting the independence Marina had spiritually, financially and socially, especially since she had never married. In her first confession, she declares that perhaps the reason she has been arrested was because of a conversation she had had with a non believer. She informs the committee that she had already told her order’s priest about this and was absolved. She is then sent back to her cell and told to reexamine her memory. Three days later, Marina again confesses to the same conversation and was again sent back to her cell to go over her thoughts. Then her narrative starts to get weird. &lt;br /&gt;One day later, on her third confession, she began confessing to seeing a hallucination of Christ and body aches similar to what might have been the onset of menopause. She then describes what sounds like an epileptic seizure and astral flight. The court then set her back to her cell (and probably took away her mushroom stash). The next day she starts to describe another delusion that depicted…hell? Somehow, in this version, Christ superimposed himself on her “former” fiancé, then she got drunk, and (if I understand this correctly) got married and had sex with him, before waking up the next morning, probably with one hell of a hangover and trying to figure out what had happened the night before; too bad Marina did not have Alan Jackson to sing her the explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days later she confesses eating meat at times it is restricted by her faith and asks for forgiveness. Then nearly two months later Marina, literally lets the “(pussy) cat out of the bag” She divulges to the committee that fact that she has been “self-sustaining” sexually for at least the last fifteen years, where upon “came to pollution”, (i.e. orgasm), but only a couple of times every other month or so. From self-love, she then admits to having sex with Juan Nunez, apparently an accountant, also living among her order. Actually, she not only admits to having sex, but to specific and descriptive sexual acts. Then next day she confesses to having sex with another man, Alonso Gutierrez, as well as more masturbation. Then next day, she admitted to sexual acts with a former priest, who was now in China.&lt;br /&gt;Her ninth and final confession, Marina admits to having a sexual relationship with another beata in her order. Finally, on February 2nd, oddly enough the Day of Purification, Marina decides she has confessed enough. She was later convicted, her punishment being gagged, bound, while partially nude, beat a hundred times, fined, and sentenced to a live in a plague hospital, where it appears she became ill and died. &lt;br /&gt;So what can we take away from this bizarre story? First, the longer someone is held in prison, the more things they will confess to. Second, Marina starting confessing things before she ever knew why she was there or by whom the Inquistition had gotten her name. Third, she admitted to sexual behaviors, which she was punished for, though she had only taken a promise to be celibate, unlike the vows nuns were required to adhere by. Fourth, the Order of Saint Dominic was a very “loving” and sexual group of believers. It appears that Marina’s punishment was intended to kill her, but my question would be, why did it take nearly two years after her confessions for her to be punished? Also, were there records of who actually turned her in and for what charges? Were they punished in a manner similar to Marina, or was she punished worse because she was an independent, female beata?&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-9114571600405686155?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;It’s like being at a climax, then pausing to watch Fox News…&lt;br /&gt;My question is how come society in the 17th century allowed women legal protections under the law, yet by the time the 20th century rolled around, they had absolutely none? The opening of Women’s Lives in Colonial Quito by Kimberly Gauderman, gives two examples of two married women, separated and in essence, hiding themselves from their abusive husbands. Both women, Maria and Ventura (dona Ventura de Zarate), asked the local law enforcement to intervene on their behalf regarding the domestic violence imposed on them by their estranged spouses. Maria’s plight went completely ignored, while the police did intervene on Ventura’s behalf. Gauderman never does give an explanation as to what social and legal changes brought about the full usage of the patriarchal imposed limitations of rights, with regards to women and child, and leaves the reader to gather their own assumptions as to the cause(s). &lt;br /&gt;Despite this, Gauderman does extensively explain how she gathered much of her information, and uses it to bring a well rounded glimpse into the lives of women in Ecuador during the colonial period. I also found chapters 1-3 more stimulating than the last two; especially chapter three on the criminal justice system and women.  I find it completely interesting that the ecclesiastical court, which granted very few divorces, contradicted the secular courts, yet women bonded to bad marriages, could find relief in the secular realm.  In fact, Gauderman’s example of the priest, Maestro Francisco de la Vega, giving his parishioner, Agustina de la Vega (no known relation to priest Vega), sound advice on how to deal with her philandering excuse of a husband; sue him! Again, though Gauderman gives details into the case, I was again left confused; and no it is not because I am a natural blonde… We are told that Augustina sued her husband for what we can assume was abandonment, adultery, and domestic violence. However, the reader is left without knowing if this was part of a divorce suit or what the outcome of the case was; trust me, it has been driving me up a wall because no where have I been able to find the outcome and it is kind of like reading a book, only to find out the last chapter is missing and the book is out of print. This again shows that Gauderman has excellent sources and examples, yet for some unknown reason, wants to torture the reader by never telling the entire story. &lt;br /&gt;I did learn an interesting fact I never knew before I read this book. I never realized that when Queen Isabella died, her daughter would gain the throne, rather than her husband; I am also still confused as to how Ferdinand was able to maintain control of both empire’s despite this legacy. According to Gauderman, the two empires were not unified again until Charles I took over and co-ruled with his mother until her death. Unfortunately, I had to look up online as to exactly how and why this happened. I realize that Gauderman used certain examples, such as the one above, to show that patriarchy was a permeable state of the family gave women power not only within the family structure, but also within her community; and therefore her society during the colonial period in Quito, but most of the book felt like an economic historical archive; like a sex instruction manual using mundane photos to illustrate correct execution of the matter at hand.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-6210709566555640091?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;This week during discussion we talked about women in the nunnery during and how they had to live by certain rules if not the Inquisition could bring them up on charges. Women especially women in the church were closely watched. They had to uphold their beliefs and never questioned it or do any thing that would bring any attention to them that would also questioned their faith as well. A person we been talking about concerning this topic is Sor Juana. She was a scholar and also a nun in New Spain. We currently watching a movie entitled I, the Worst of All. This movie was somewhat a depiction of Sor Juana life. This movie showed how a nun in Mexico during the seventeenth century was looked down upon because of being vocal in her beliefs, when the only way for a woman to be was to be submissive towards a man. This movie showed that Sor Juana was a woman before her time. She was very intelligence and introduced new ideas that were very foreign. Her ideas were not favor because she was a woman and much thought that her ideas went against the church. Many people in the church wanted to bring Sor Juana in front of the Inquisition but Vicereine was protecting her. The Vicereine took a certain interest in Sor Juana because of her charm and intelligence. She also loved Sor Juana’s poetry as well.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that Sor Juana was a very intelligent woman and that she was misunderstood by many especially the men around her. These men in my opinion were somewhat threaten by her intelligence and were jealous of how she was favored by so many. I think they also viewed her as a threat against their faith but should had just gotten to know her and understand her views. Sor Juanan was just exploring the world around her but also stay true to her faith. She wanted to somewhat uplift women in her country and enlighten the world of things they never knew about that might could make people understand themselves better.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/811234197297643948-5916456923779601287?l=ras2011.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;“I, Worst of All” depicts the life of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, who has been hailed the first Latin American Poet. The movie begins in 1680 with the arrival of a new Viceroy and his wife as well as the new misogynic Archbishop. The movie opens with the performance of a play Juana has written and the Viceroy and his wife are taken with Juana&amp;#8217;s passion and gift for writing. Where as the Archbishop promptly denounces the nunnery &amp;#8220;a bordello.&amp;#8221; Juana became a nun in order to access the knowledge and books ordinarily forbidden to women. She had a passion for learning and had amassed the largest library in Latin America. Then, sin of sins, she had the audacity to express herself and her own ideas through the written word. She quickly became popular for her poems and plays and gained the protection of the Viceroy and his wife. For a time, Juana received not only the protection but friendship of the Viceroy’s wife and the two became involved in sort of a passionate, yet chaste love affair. When asked why she never wanted children, Juana responds by pointing to her books, sundial, astrolabe, and telescope claiming these were her children.  She believed she possessed the sort of freedom that would have been denied her had she gotten married and had children as was expected. However, not everyone was so enthralled by her work or her voracious desire to learn, which was considered the province of men and the Archbishop was not to be dissuaded from his goal of bringing the lascivious poet down Viceroy or no. When the Viceroy was dismissed from his position and sent back to Spain, Juana was left without vulnerable and without defense. Manipulated and betrayed, Juana faced the anger of the Inquisition and suffered the consequences of stepping outside her conceived gender&amp;nbsp;role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie sums up some of the worst aspects of a “male dominated” society, even as women found ways to circumvent convention and express themselves in a way that did not involve matrimony or having children, they still ran the risk of losing everything even their lives when the Inquisition was in full swing. Although, it was interesting that she was supported by so many prominent political and religious men. She unfortunately also made powerful enemies who saw to her eventual&amp;nbsp;fall.&lt;/p&gt;

It is about Sister Juana Ines de la Cruz, a woman who was forced to chose between a life free from legal and Church oppression, yet void of the very things that mean the most to her, tools of learning, or a life that is constantly scrutinized by Church officials, yet having access to a world of scientific and literary resources.  She chose the latter because it was the only way she would be able to live mostly independently and have access to books, scientific tools, and be free to write beautiful poetry, although it came at a price.  It was heartbreaking to see her so lonely.  Her close friends, the Viceroy and Vicereine left for Spain and her own confessor left her, leaving her extremely vulnerable against the strong male oppressors of the Catholic Church.  They felt as if she was taking advantage of all the resources the Church made available to her, but she did not seem thankful to God for it.  Another huge conflict between Juana and her love for writing and learning was that women were not supposed to learn things for themselves, but were told what to believe and do.  She was seen as dangerous and suspicious and could not be trusted.  I am interested to see the end of this movie.  Surely the Church cannot kick her out of the convent and let her be free in society; she would certainly be more “dangerous” out there without the oversight of the church.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4551310302796999455-6033181942835274380?l=laurenhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed watching the depiction of Sor Juana this week in class in &lt;em&gt;I, the Worst of All. &lt;/em&gt;Visualizing the time period can be difficult, so seeing someone&amp;#8217;s take via film was quite interesting. Mostly due to my upbringing in the 21st century, I can have a biased viewpoint when discussing the women, in particular, during past times. When I say biased I mean that I always can&amp;#8217;t imagine how women just accepted their roles in society without the options as most men did, but then again, I need to work on my historical viewpoint. Regardless, Sor Juana seemed to represent the &amp;#8220;feminist&amp;#8221; woman of the time, whether she meant to or not, by stepping outside the norm as much as possible with her love of knowledge and intelligence. Yes, she was a part of the church, one of the few choices women had in life during this time, the other being marriage, but even so , she utilized this position to her advantage. Clearly, the church was a place where women could get an education, and I would have to imagine I would have chosen the life of a nun if born during such times, as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it difficult to accept that Sor Juana was such a threat to the church. I understand that her love of learning meant discussing theology possibly considered heretical to the church, but then again, I cannot imagine that men in other monasteries were not engaging in the same type of reading. It seems that Sor Juana in particular was just dealing with an Archbishop who was in particular not fond of women in general. Were they threatening to&amp;nbsp;him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does seem that Sor Juana was a poineer for women&amp;#8217;s rights although she probably had no intention of calling it that. It was very interesting to see nuns portrayed in more actual behavior as opposed to the idealized notions I think we tend to hear/read more about. They did have passions and&amp;nbsp;feelings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to sexuality, there was definitely a portrayel of sexual tension between Sor Juana and the Vicereine. It seemed that the Vicereine, as portrayed in the film, had more intention than just a friendship with Sor Juana. Overall, though, I thought this depiction was a nice reflection of Sor Juana and her contributions to gaining equal status under such a patriarchical&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title type="html">Why Celebrate Sor Juana?</title>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div&gt;I must admit I both thoroughly am enjoying the film &lt;i&gt;I, Worst of All&lt;/i&gt; and am rather intrigued and confused by many aspects of it, namely the receptiveness of both some Spanish and Mexican clergypersons and political figures. It seems counterintuitive that during that time period Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz would have received such professional and intellectual respect from men within the Church but especially from men outside the Church. I particularly was fascinated by such when it became clear that her piety was both different and lacking. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Living as a poet and scientist more than a nun, Sor Juana certainly epitomized those who entered the monastery on account of the resources available there as opposed to the desire for absolute spiritual service. As those not “fascinated” by her frequently declared, she living a luxurious life as a black veil rather than a life dedicated to God. Sor Juana’s argument that her poetry is her service to God seems rather empty to me - she wrote that poetry for herself, for the intended person, for art and knowledge’s sakes, to build a legacy, etc. but not for the glory of God - or at least it appears to me. While the poems may not have been sacrilegious, it doesn’t seem that her intention was to glorify God through her gift but to glorify herself, which would be ok if she were not posing as a religious person, not to mention a nun (servant of God and bride of Christ). &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Her comments about avoiding being chained down to a man as well as her interaction with the Vicereine force me to consider her sexuality. Although I cannot form any definitive opinions until concluding the movie (any reading more about her), it seems to me that Sor Juana may well be in love with the Vicereine - not a blanket lesbian - but in love with her specifically. Sor Juana seems so very opposed to marriage and romantic relationships with men in general, considering them an extensive of the repressive patriarchal system she has attempted to escape her whole life. In the monastery, she found a few nuns with whom she could share her thoughts and dreams but few with whom she could truly relate; however, the Vicereine appealed to Sor Juana with a sense of shared past and present, allowing her sense of isolation and loneliness to lessen. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I was rather confused by the handful of scenes involving Sor Juana and the Vicereine that could have simply demonstrated the depth of their friendship and connection as isolated women or could have been rather sexual - such as her unlacing the Vicereine’s dress/corset and the Vicereine’s telling Sor Juana she was only hers and kissing her. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Essentially, curious as to other’s opinions on this and anxious to see the conclusion. I truly am rather perplexed as to how Sor Juana received such acclaim as a nun both while she was alive and post-mortem; she clearly was very clever and innovative but she does not seem to have in any way have used those talents in the direction of the Church or its furtherance. So why is she such a celebrated nun? &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;This week we explored beatas,  unofficial nuns who were still very religious and devoted to the Catholic church. These nuns were not officially recognized by the church but lived in convents and did about everything an official nun did. The Inquisition was often on the watch for nuns like this for signs of heresy because of the fact that they did not go through the same things like women who became official nuns. We looked at two cases recently of two beatas who got in trouble with the church and had a run in with the inquisition. The first of these was a beata by the name of Marina de San Miguel who was arrested by the Inquisition in November and question for 4 months before &amp;#8220;released&amp;#8221;.  The Inquisition brought people in &amp;#8220;arresting them&amp;#8221; and they held them in captivity for an unset period of time, then for a week or so they would bring the person in or questioning asking northing but open ended questions. Since the person doesn&amp;#8217;t know why they were arrested it makes them think of anything they could possibly have been arrested for and they&amp;#8217;ll confess all sorts of things. Marina confessed of a conversation wit ha man about whether or not Satan exists, something that could be considered heresy but the Inquisition sent her back to think some more. As the weeks dragged on her confessions got weirder and she confessed to masturbating to an image of God, having a relationship 20 years ago with her nephew, and a couple other random things to try and figure out why she was being held. This tactic used by the Inquisition was very effective in weeding out heretics or getting information on other people if the person they had presently wasn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next case was of the beata in the movie we watched whose love for knowledge and free thinking began to get her in trouble with the church. She had a ton of books and poems she had written and tons of artifacts around her room but free thinking people and especially women were seen as dangerous in the eyes of the church. This didn&amp;#8217;t help with the fact that the Archbishop actually hated women and thought they had a certain role within the church and this further got Juana in trouble when she spoke out against him. Although she had gained some respect from the Vice Roy and his wife and a few others that did not stop the Church from condemning her and to try and force her back into the path of&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of all this is that beatas were dangerous women because they were unofficial nuns who had access to the same education official nuns did but were targeted more  for not taking the same&amp;nbsp;steps.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone!  This week we saw a very interesting movie on the lives of nuns in early Latin America.  After discussing, in class, why there were so many nuns in Mexico at that time, it was good seeing a movie to help us understand it better and have a more elaborate way to visualize it.  For me I was a bit surprised to see that some nuns were allowed to read and write as much as some did.  In Dona Marina case it was clear that she became a nun because she wanted to be educated.  It shows when she had the flash back of her childhood, and goes to her mother dressed like a man studying in a university, also because she loves to read and write so much.  It was sad to see when she lost her rights to read the large number of book, because you know it’s her passion, and in a way she gave up her rights to get married to become a nun, and all to have a good education.  I even think she would rather be educated than keep on praying to God.  Because when she gets the books taken away, the men tell her to pray and she said “why should I pray when I think that God is deaf.” Another part of the movie that was a hard to see was when Dona Marina’s mother gets mad at her for becoming a nun, all while she was on her death bed.  You can tell that Dona Marina is disturbed by this and it has made the sting of lousing her books even&amp;nbsp;harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One part of the movie that I had a hard time understanding was the relationship between Dona Marina and the Queen.  For someone seeing this movie in 2010 I have a feeling that the Queen likes Dona Marina as more than a friend, because she asked her to undo her middle part of her dress, and the Queen also asked her to take off her veil than gives her a kiss on the lips.  This did not look so innocent to me but rather sexual.  I am not sure that Dona Marina feels the same way, if I am reading into this right.  If I am not right about this hunch, it could be because this cultural of early Latin America may have been a bit more touchy feely than our current America cultural, and also it may have been normal for women to have more of a stronger and closer relationship than the heterosexual women of our time do.  Although we have not seen the conclusion of this movie, I can say that I have enjoyed&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/utayala10.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=utayala10.wordpress.com&amp;blog=11615662&amp;post=22&amp;subd=utayala10&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Though I am not one to readily criticize the Holy Catholic Church, I found the movie we watched in class relatively disturbing, especially with the Church’s treatment toward a nun with intelligence. One might try to point out the bishopric ordering the burning of books as something to find disheartening, but that barely registered. Instead, in the story the nun, who was incredibly intelligent and a brilliant poet, is only allowed to commence with her work because of the protection of the viceroy and his wife. There is an implication of a homosexual attraction between the nun and the viceroy’s wife, but that is inconsequential for her persecution. Rather, she is seen as a threat because of her poetry, which it could be argued contains certain heresies. Also, there is a part where she interprets the sacred scriptures and writes book contrary to some Portuguese theologian the bishop loves. In his zealotry, the bishop wages a misogynistic war against the nun.  The final scene we observed in class revolved around the nun working with the poor and her previous confessor, the person to whom she gave confession, told her she was now in her proper place. She had been humbled and was supposedly working how the Lord would want her to work. This movie gave a long narrative concerning the patriarchal bigotry within the&amp;nbsp;Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the whole scenario disturbing because she was not a threat to the Church, yet they persecuted her. In fact, she was most likely an asset to the Holy Church, and they failed to see because she was a woman. I feel it is important to point out all the women in Biblical history first that has shown God believes them capable of aiding Israel/the Church. Tziporah, Deborah, Esther, Ruth, Judith, and Mary all influenced Judeo-Christianity for the better. However, where my criticism of the Church comes is when they referenced St. Theresa of Lisieux, one of three female doctors of the Church. This saint was known for praying and working and finding God in the little things. To me, it appeared that the Church only accepted women when they knew their place and did not challenge authority. This is antithetical to the ideas of the Church, but geopolitical chauvinism took hold that prevented them from seeing the usefulness of female leaders. The nun in the movie offered a rare gem of brilliance that the Church should have cultivated. Instead, they let their agendas get in the way. This leads me to the conclusion that patriarchy lasted so long because men were unwilling to give up power. It had nothing to do with their sex as much as it had to do a select class of people trying to maintain their monopoly on control of the&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This week we talked some more about the role of religion in defining gender roles in colonial Latin America. The Inquisition case of Marina de San Miguel displayed just how prominent the Church was in daily life, and as such it&amp;#8217;s no surprise that if a woman did not marry, the only other really appetizing option was to join a nunnery. The movie we watched last week was really good because it provided a visual representation of the things we have been talking about the last couple of weeks (nunneries, women and education). It&amp;#8217;s pretty easy to conclude that at this time women still had a significantly inferior role in comparison to men, although I admit I was surprised that some could study and even be admired for their literary works. The ability to censor and remove educational materials when the writings became too secular displays this inequality best.  I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised if gender roles shifted significantly when the Church became less a part of society and daily life. The Church at this time was an institution in which women having leadership roles was forbidden by spiritual beliefs, and in such a system there is really no chance for a woman to gain the same status as a man. Perhaps only a nun could even come close through writings, but as the movie showed, even then she would still be under complete control of the male-dominated&amp;nbsp;Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is the last blog post for this class, I think it&amp;#8217;s important to look back at what we&amp;#8217;ve talked about this semester as a whole. We&amp;#8217;ve covered several centuries, and looked at gender roles all across Latin America. First, we defined what gender, sex, and sexuality really mean, and then we applied these definitions to the indigenous pre-conquest cultures and saw a variety of gender systems&amp;#8212;many which were surprisingly equal. It seems the arrival of the Spanish brought a system of less equality, and as Spanish notions of gender met indigenous ones the two mixed. The Church seems to be the defining factor in Spanish gender notions, as most beliefs of how a man or woman should act is derived from Church officials&amp;#8217; interpretation of the scriptures. It&amp;#8217;s kind of interesting to realize that pretty much in every culture we looked at, gender roles were tied to spiritual beliefs&amp;#8211;it was the cosmos with the Indians in South America, it was the &amp;#8220;spiritual war&amp;#8221; in pre-conquest Mexico. This contrasts I think with modern society, where we derive our ideas of gender less from religion and more from other social arenas. This is really a reflection of how much society has changed over the last few centuries. I think the most important thing to take from this class is the understanding that gender roles have changed throughout history, and can give pretty good insights into the values of a culture and the way it operates. By studying gender relations and the way the change over time you will have a much greater and more accurate understanding of historical events that took place, and thus studying gender is essential when studying&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The chapters in Gauderman&amp;#8217;s book &lt;em&gt;Women&amp;#8217;s Lives in Colonial Quito&lt;/em&gt; on the work that women did in colonial society are fascinating.  Throughout the book Gauderman argues that the notions of patriarchy that many posess don&amp;#8217;t really apply to colonial Spanish American society.  These chapters are especially convincing because she is able to demonstrate how mcuh women actively participated in the economic life of the times.  In colonial Quito, women owned and operated small textile factories, owned and operated small grocery stores (pulperias), owned land, marketed goods in the street, loaned money, and owned slaves.  Of course, race and class affected which women could do what.  For example, Spanish women often owned pulperias but would pay lower class women and men (often mestizo) to operate them.  Indigenous women, mestizas, and blacks were the ones who most often sold goods in the street.  However, Gauderman shows that both Spanish women and non-Spanish women owned land and loaned money.  In fact Gauderman says that women were often the people who kept actual money flowing through the economy.  Women with even a little money would loan it out&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender and property in colonial Spanish America also played out in interesting ways.  Married women had, to a large extent, complete control over their property even after marriage, unlike in colonial British America, where property automatically became the husband&amp;#8217;s once the marriage took place.  Women, then, remained financially independent after marriage.  They could even loan their spouses money and sue if it wasn&amp;#8217;t paid&amp;nbsp;back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gauderman&amp;#8217;s point in all of this is to point out how the bureaucratic decentralism practiced by the colonial government and the Spanish crown influenced colonial Spanish American society.  In an effort to stop any one group from concentrating power, the crown created and encouraged competition and overlapping jurisdiction.  In the same way, marriage became a space of competition and competing jurisdictions.  To prevent the male patriarchs from gaining to much economic power, property was left to a great extent in the hands of&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The concept of the beata, which we discussed this week, is very interesting. These women lived lives devoted to the service of God, taking vows of chastity and abstaining from other vices, but did so without the supervision of an established monastery or church. This kind of independent lifestyle was rather unique for women at the time, especially one devoted to the church. Often women who lived on their own were associated with sinful activities and defiance of religious mandates. But these ladies claimed that they were living under God&amp;#8217;s will, relinquishing their own desires. Such a contradiction raised interesting issues in society and often caused complicated problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a beata must have been an attractive opportunity for women at the time. Much in the way that some convents allowed the nuns a comfortable lifestyle, the life of a beata offered even greater freedom and peace, without the intervention of the leaders who governed the monasteries. They could continue in their former position in society under the vague constrictions of their own personal vows to God. They often lived in communities together, supporting themselves by selling goods and performing other tasks without the domination of men or the urge to marry in order to maintain their way of life. But a group of women living together with no supervision made a lot of people very nervous. Church leaders, in particular, worried that if people, particularly women, were able to craft their own interpretations of the Scriptures without any censorship or surveillance they would be led astray and accept doctrines of highly questionable validity. Beatas were of particular concern to the Inquisition, since they claimed a role in the religious structure of the community but did not conform to the requirements of a traditional nun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case of Marina de San Miguel, an older beata brought before the Inquisition, is an example of how the skepticism of church leaders was aroused. In her first hearing, she appeared to be a pious, hard-working woman, having provided vital assistance to her family and saved enough money to buy her own house despite having several difficult challenges to overcome in her life. But as the Inquisition instructed her to &amp;#8220;examine her memory&amp;#8221; and determine the reason that she was brought in, she eventually confessed outrageous offenses such as having relations with the devil and a man named Juan Nunez. It is likely that she was a victim of Juan&amp;#8217;s misleading and was very confused about the condition of her soul, given the images in her visions, but to the church, it was clear that regardless of her intent, her independent lifestyle had led to her despicable condition that might have been prevented under the guidance of a monastery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, despite the threat posed to individual souls, I think the church also recognized the threat that the position of beata posed to their own institutions. The more that people felt they could interpret the Scriptures on their own and take care of their own struggle for salvation, the less power the church wielded in the community. This was likely the primary motivation for the excessive use of the Inquisition. Rooting out heretics emphasized the real Biblical truth, but those arrested also served as an example to those who were unsure of the church&amp;#8217;s power. In a time when the state was usurping much of the church&amp;#8217;s jurisdiction, it was vital that they maintain all control over religious thought. Growing independence, as usual, was a threat to established authority.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-2172805566673923135?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Okay. before this title makes me sound too sexist, I want to give an explanation.  Do I believe that dowries were a good idea? Yes.  Do I believe that they were utilized properly?  No.  Dowries where given to women with an idea that they would never get to take advantage of them.  But they absolutely&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to examine the case of dona Maria Pino Argote. First, let me start by saying she symbolizes every white trash trailer mom out there. Now, so you all won&amp;#8217;t bitch at me, my own mother is a small town, close minded individual. I was raised in a one red light town with very little to talk about other than local sports or politics. But&amp;#8230;.I personally think that owning a dowry should not give a woman the right to economic independence as it gave her (Maria Pino Argote).  Come one, the only reason she was able to support her children is because of what her husband gave&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clearly stated in the reading that she had no obvious grounds to sue.  So why did she?  she sued because she knew the laws and knew she could benefit from them.  The father had given her everything she had and I would bet that the children wanted to be with the father but no&amp;#8230;she had the dowry&amp;#8230;she had the right&amp;#8230;and she got the&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it didn&amp;#8217;t always work out like this and I know that a dowry was a great thing to have. If you were a woman. Especially a poor woman with no social background.  Dona Maria&amp;#8217;s husband wanted his children just as bad as she did, most likely, but because of the dowry, he had no way of getting them.  So this dowry, which her husband gave her, gave her complete power over him.  I&amp;#8217;m sorry but this is bullshit, and if it were the reverse situation I would say it is bullshit too!.  The female should not get economical independence simply from a dowry.  What did she put into the relationship to deserve all of the&amp;nbsp;power&amp;#8230;..Nothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be&amp;nbsp;continued&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;In modern times, the most common image of a nun is a woman dressed in dark robes with her head covered, living in a convent without many contemporary conveniences or luxuries. However, in colonial Latin America, convents were much more diverse in their beliefs and practices than they typically are in North America today. I found it very interesting to consider what life was like in a convent for upper class women in that time period, especially compared to the life they would have had if they had not joined the convent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, a woman of the upper class who took vows to become a nun did not necessarily have to take a vow of poverty. In fact, some of them lived in rather fancy apartments with many of the luxuries that they had been accustomed to before entering the church. Beyond this, they could use some of their free time to study and engage in other pursuits according to their desires. Such a life was certainly not unattractive to a young woman from the upper class as an alternative to marriage. Religious convictions were certainly a strong motivation, since all good Catholics were concerned with the salvation of their souls, but it was also nice for them to be comfortable in the convent as they served the Lord and the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had they not joined the church, such woman would most likely have been married at a fairly young age to a man from her social class. She would then have received her dowry, which was her portion of her parents&amp;#8217; inheritance. As a wife she would have been in charge of her household, completing several important tasks and supervising the other members of the home in their jobs. There would not necessarily have been much time for intellectual pursuits or leisure activities, though wealth certainly provided more access to those activities. For a woman who valued solitude and a calm lifestyle, the convent could offer peace and time for enjoyments in addition to the ever-important prayer and service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One famous woman who sought such an existence was Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz. She used her time in the convent to study philosophy and literature, and became one of the most prominent Latin American poets. Supported by the Viceroy, she was allowed to live a life of ease in order to follow and perfect her art. Had she been married or had to support herself as a doncella, such a lifestyle would probably not have been possible. The fact that the church was able to offer support to women seeking a life in the church led to a group of women practicing religious piety without sacrificing all of their liberties or individuality. While the vow of poverty and abstinence from other elements of the modern life was important to some, it was good for the church and the convents to allow diversity in the lives of nuns so that more women had access to a life of semi-independence.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-5408576716182773846?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found our discussion of the Inquisition the past week to be both enlightening and a little disturbing. To me, what exactly the Inquisition involved has always been somewhat of a mystery, and it was interesting to learn about how this famous event was carried out in Latin America. The Inquisition might have resembled in some regards a court case with religious overtones, but as we looked at it I couldn&amp;#8217;t but help notice how different the process was compared to the judicial&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s somewhat frightening to think that the Inquisition could apprehend someone that they were simply suspicious of. Just like that a person could disappear, spending weeks, months, and in some cases years in entirely secret prisons. The idea that a person&amp;#8217;s life could be controlled in such a way is frightening both because there was such a lack of rights for the person being taken, and because it shows how much control the Church had in the daily lives of the people in Latin America. I have observed before how interrelated the Church and the daily lives of people were at this time, but this is evidence of an even deeper amount of control that I had not realized before. The fact that a person could be locked away without even being told what they were accused of shows a frightening level of Church&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of Marina de San Maguel that we spent so much time on displays this perfectly&amp;#8211;a 52 year old woman was taken without being told what she was accused of, and was imprisoned for months while being forced to divulge anything in her life that was sinful. In the process, she pretty much had to tell all the private things in her life in an attempt to figure out whatever the Inquisition was waiting for her to say. Even more horrible, after this long drawn out trial, she was thrown in prison for two years, then paraded around naked, given 100 lashes, and sent to a &amp;#8220;plague hospital&amp;#8221;. The victim had no rights at all in these situations, and this instance where 9 confessions were taken is probably just an example of the many things that went on with the Inquisition. What I gather from cases like this is the extreme lack of rights people had in this society. The fact that they could be taken and thrown into a secret prison for simply being suspected of religious heresy is&amp;nbsp;disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Talk about domination.  These catholic nun really worked in numbers.  One thing that really catches my attention is the similarity in religious women then and religious women now.  I was not raised in Catholic school and I don&amp;#8217;t know much about traditional Catholic customs but I can tell you That I was raised in a small town southern baptist church and while hardly any of the customs are the same, there is one that is.  Women in today&amp;#8217;s churches seem more prevalent than men, hands down.  I have always wondered, growing up why it was always a male preacher, and while there were men in the church, there were many more&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this phenomenon has carried over.  Other than The tradition of classes among the nuns (black veils and white veils)Maybe this is why when I am back home I feel overwhelmed in church merely because of the number of old women breathing down my neck.  I am a very religious person but I feel that females, being more emotional beings, have different feelings for church and religion than men. Could it be a comfort thing? Possibly. Are women just more religious? Could be that too.  Either way you look at it, the domination of women in the Catholic church was very ordinary and evangelism  spread like a wild&amp;nbsp;fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole dominance of there church in general truly makes me feel lucky that I do not live in a time like this.  I can&amp;#8217;t imagine an environment where the church rules&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt; I must admit that I did not enjoy the topics our readings covered this past week in any particular way.  That is not to say, by any means, that I found the information put me into a mood of disinterest.  Who wouldn’t find something engaging to study when covering the efforts and accusations of the Inquisition?  To me, the most intriguing facet of the inquisition’s escapades was the deplorable methodology implemented by the Catholic Church.  The forced confessions of Marina de San Miguel serve as a superb example of said methodology.  Firstly, countless peoples brought before the leaders of the Inquisition were captured, or arrested, in secrecy and held in secret prisons.  Think about that for a moment, it is a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SECRET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;PRISON&lt;/span&gt; in which the detainees were often contained.  Its secrecy of these institutions would seemingly imply that the detainees were most likely robbed of socializing with peers, hygienic living conditions, perhaps even of daylight.&lt;br /&gt;
    What was even more odious was the means by which the inquisitors extracted information and confessions from those being held.  The majority of prisoners being held for questioning were typically given completely open ended questions such as, “why are you here?”  Utilizing a system of coercion and repression, both of which were essential tactics of the Inquisition, will always lead to submission and a loss of willpower.  These were the two pillars upon which the power of the Inquisition stood.  For while many, if not most, of the Inquisition’s victims were originally detained for specific reasons, the church would simply subject them to elongated forms of suffering until information was attained.  Furthermore, this information would hardly ever contain the slightest hint of truth!  The human imagination is capable of producing any story or image, especially when contained to a prison cell.  Naturally, in desperate attempts at liberation by any means possible, those detained would commonly give information of their own personal enemies, friends, neighbors, or family members.  Not unlike what detainees said of themselves, the validity of these stories was normally subjective.  In retrospect, I find it very difficult to fathom the immediate and long-term results of these religious endeavors.  What began as efforts to oust heretics gradually became diluted by cruel tactics and abusive treatment of religious prisoners.  Coupling these implements of torture and strict living conditions with attempts to gather incriminating evidence and information on others, who had not been captured, ultimately morphed the Inquisition into little more than a political and religious&amp;nbsp;fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The Spanish came to the “new world” and conquered every indigenous civilization with many goals in mind, not the least of which being the acquisition of gold and land; however, there was one other much holier purpose: the evangelism of the Indigenous people, what was left of them. Within Latin America there were two groups that served to minister to the people, there were the secular priests that served the Spanish population and religious orders such as the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Augustinians that saw to the indigenous community. Overcoming local culture would not be an easy thing so these religious orders served as a towering presence in the community burning idols and ancient religious texts. They then attempted to incorporate indigenous elements in order to shape beliefs using visual representation. Despite the attempts to incorporate a limited amount of indigenous beliefs by some orders, baptism, marriage, and burial rituals completely changed for the&amp;nbsp;Indians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church soon became a dominant force in Latin America as an institution of social control, religious authority, and even a financial institution. The sources of income such as tithes, donations, and income from the real estate the church was located on provided the church with the ability to make loans. There were also financial connections between the nobility and the church. This close relationship between the church and the elite paved the way for the church lending to local noble families. Then the lesser sons of the local elite often became priests as they would have little or no inheritance. Children of the elite joining the church did not stop at sons though; daughters with dowries could become&amp;nbsp;nuns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that the church provided a safe haven for women who wanted to live pious religious lives or those who desired to escape marriage became increasingly popular. At one point during the seventeenth century, Lima, Peru had 1,000 nuns. It was not a vocation strictly for daughters with dowries now. Within the convent or monastery itself there were black veil nuns, women who had a substantial dowry given to the church and white veil nuns who often served the black veils. Then there were beatas, who were “unofficial nuns” or women who gave vows of chastity but were not considered nuns. The option of joining the church provided a respectable safe alternative to marriage and allowed women some amount of autonomy and even a chance for an education they might not otherwise receive. On other words an attractive alternative to an unhappy marriage or a life doomed to&amp;nbsp;housework.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;This week talking about Catholic Nuns seemed very interesting.  I never knew that there were different kinds of nuns.  Growing up Catholic and attending Catholic schools from Kindergarten through senior year I have grown accustom to seeing them walk the halls of my schools and churches.  While taking many years of religion classes, they did not talk too much about the history of Nuns and why some Nuns had black or white veils.  I have often wondered why some Nuns had white veils, but for some reason I never asked.  I think it is due to the fact that I have mostly only seen nuns with black veils, and I have only seen white veiled nuns a hand full of times.  Going to class, in a secular university, I finally knew why!  All for the reason of having nuns who grew up wealthy (white veils) and for the nuns who grew up middle or lower class (black veil).  This kind of makes sense that I was not taught that going to Catholic schools, due to the fact that, it in a way, was not very Christen like, to have a destined symbol of wealth over others (white veil).  Another thing from this past week’s lecturer class was that many women in Latin America chose to become nuns.  With thirty or more percent of Latin American women becoming nuns it shows that it was a good option for them.  Knowing that it was a good way to be educated, and for the most part women seeming to have a better thirst for knowledge, due to the fact that many of them were not sent to school, becoming a nun must have seemed very liberating.  It must have also been a good option for women who never had any interest in getting married, for whatever reason, or for getting out of a bad relationship.  In the hands of the parents I can understand that they would rather have their daughters become nuns than get married to a man.  For one thing they did not have to give too much of a dowry to the Catholic Church, giving them the option to save it for themselves or the rest of their family.  It sounds a bit harsh to be stingy like that, but I can understand that in a world where money is not easy to come by and every bit counts.  Also for many of the good Fathers of the Latin American women I can see why they would rather have their daughters join the Church, where for the most part were very respected and had good lives, than married to a man who could have been abuse them and treat them like second class citizens.  All in all becoming a nun may have been the best option for women because of the respect that came with being a&amp;nbsp;nun.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;We discussed prominent women figures to the Catholic Church, including the Virgin of Guadalupe, or the most important Mary in Latin America, and Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the most famous nun in Latin America.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We also discussed the organization of the Catholic Church and it’s use as a financial institution.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Another interesting topic was the differences between the white veil nuns and black veil nuns.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I did not realize that even the nuns were subject to social and economic hierarchy.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The black veil nuns did not take a vow of poverty and came from upper class families and spent most of their time studying and concentrating more on spiritual matters and less on physical.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The white veil nuns were more like how we think of nuns today.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They took a vow of poverty and bore the brunt of the labor.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We also discussed the reasons why most females (especially those from prominent families) chose to become nuns instead of marrying and raising a family.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The numbers of women who professed to convents were surprising; 77% of female from prominent families joined convents, while only 14% married.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The reasons why these women chose this route were understandable.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One major factor was education.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The only way women could receive an education was through the Church.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Another reason why a woman may choose this life was because of family and economic strategy.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A daughter that chose to become a nun required a smaller dowry up front as opposed to one that got married.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Lastly, a woman may rather live in autonomy without a man governing over her, so that she can devote her concentrations on God.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is also interesting, though not surprising, that women who did not join convents, &lt;i style=&#34;&#34;&gt;beatas&lt;/i&gt;, were usually held suspect as immoral women.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;These discussions about how women were involved in, and viewed by the Church were important, because during Colonial times in Latin America, the Church was mostly the center of the peoples’ lives, whether they liked it or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;While the religious sphere may have been controlled by men, it certainly seems to be dominated by women. Both in Spanish and Spanish-American societies, spirituality, religious education, religious participation, and strict religious adherence seem to be rather gendered in terms of femininity. Why is that? There are various possible explanations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-      Women, as leaders of the domestic sphere, lead the education and upbringing of children and therefore help ensure their children’s religious foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-      Women, as considered from the foundational, Biblical teachings of the Catholic tradition, are morally weak and capricious (as discussed in the previous post). Therefore, their proximity to the Church through religious education and practice is socially stressed and reinforced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For these reasons, it seems to logically follow that women entered the Church in great numbers (again, for various reasons) and that the Church perhaps targeted women in the Inquisition, as seen through Marina de San Miguel’s confession. Both women and their families had economic and social reasons to choose a life in the Church – greater independence, greater ability to pursue knowledge, less immediate financial strain on the family, etc. As time passed, the monastery was intended not just for elites but open and welcome to women of all classes; such helps explain how Sor Juana de Ines – the illegitimate daughter of a non-elite – became the most famous nun of Spanish America. With such opportunity to enter the Church, up to 77% of women in some areas preferred to do so to getting married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Church also similarly socially targeted women in the Inquisition due to the socio-religious perception of women. In reading Marina de San Miguel’s Inquisition interrogation, I was first intrigued by the secretive methods employed – secret charges, secret prison, secret abduction, etc. In analyzing her responses and the inquisitors responses to such, I wondered at the rationale for her incarceration: Marina admitted that she had consented to commit certain “evil” acts (and did commit them) but that she “did not believe that she offended God because she did not have the intention of offending him.” Clearly, the Inquisition’s presumption of guilt and manner of considering intent greatly influenced both Marina’s interrogation and her sentencing – she received 100 lashes after being paraded naked to the waist and gagged and was sentenced to a fine of 100 pesos and to ten years’ reclusion in a plague hospital (not prison but a plague hospital – what?!).&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-6087381320382404477?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The church has always been a big institution within any modern society and often where many go for moral direction. It&amp;#8217;s no surprise that when any of the European powers conquered others lands that it was done with some religious intentions. Taking territory for the King was important but it was also very important to spread the word of God to these conquered people. Spain would conquer indigenous people with their army but they would also send missionaries with them to try and convert those there and show them the Bible. It was no easy task to get people to convert to Christianity when another religion or practice was in place before for decades or centuries. The priests would have to adapt their teachings to those of the indigenous people first and in time get Christianity to take over. Once towns and homes and churches were built, converting could take full swing and in time the Spanish did get the natives to practice Christianity. But still traces of the natives old religion was placed within the churches by painting some of their gods or people in the churches on the walls. Sometimes paintings that were done by the natives often blended Jesus and the natives together like one such painting done that depicted Jesus as a child Inca King. This is odd mostly because when people think of Jesus as a kid they view him as a baby with Mary and not as a seven year old and never as a king in the monarch version. The church was often seen as a financial institution that was used to fund missionaries and pulled money from real estate and loans  and dowries in terms of women who became nuns. Women often became nuns in Latin America because it was a way for the church to gain money and then those families were given a kind of blessing from the church. Not only could the family gain something from this but also becoming a nun was the best way for a woman to get an&amp;nbsp;education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve seen a few instances when the church would send out missionaries to foreign countries to try and spread Christianity. Japan was a place where it worked a little bit but mostly failed because the Japanese were mostly just using them for their guns and when the priests tried to spread it to the common people it all ended. They were kicked out of Japan and the ones who tried to get in after that could be killed. Luckily for the Spanish they had their army in Latin America with&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Religiosity in Colonial Latin America held a specific interest for women. Many women, in fact as many as 77% in some areas, preferred to enter Church life rather than get married. This must beg the question why one would choose the Sacrament of Ordination of the Sacrament of Marriage? Several reasons could have forced the hand of women. Their parents preferred to give out a smaller dowry to the Church rather than a larger dowry to a man. Although when the parents died every child would get their fair share, in the short term this would be advantageous to the parents. Another possibility postured in class was that the women grew up in Church life and then preferred to maintain their way of life. However, I believe both of these examples fall short of explaining why so many women would prefer to live married to Jesus Christ than being married to a man of the world. There were clearly corporal advantages to living in a convent rather than becoming a homemaker like we expect so many women to today. I would submit to the reader that this was not the alternative lifestyle modern people often view the nunnery as, but rather that the women made a calculated decision and saw that life without a physical marriage to be better for them than living with a&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are cases where noble women would go into the nunnery and lead a life of luxury. They would be black veil nuns and the white veil nuns would take care of them. This distinction was based on who had the larger dowry. The wealthy nuns could then spend their lives writing and studying instead of having to work and raise children. One woman, Maria de Agreda became a prolific writer and worked on many different subjects. She wrote &amp;#8220;Divine History of the Mother of God” among other books and essays. Because she was able to write a book, this means she was able to study reading and writing to a greater extent than other women would have. Life in the convent provided her with a more leisurely life than that of wife, where should would not have had time to write books. This is, of course, not to say that all nuns had an easy life. Many had to work hard and pray all day long, which does not appeal to many people. However, there were several reasons that so many women would not want to enter into marriage. One must ask, what does this matter for women at the time? I would submit to the reader that this truly showed female empowerment. They could enter into the vocation God called them or into marriage. Contrary to what many feminists would argue, they had choices. No, they were not as diverse as today, but it demonstrates that women were not as subjugated as we are often&amp;nbsp;told.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Obviously this post concerns the case we talked about in class, but moreso through the actual primary document itself. I really had a difficult time reading this. Not because it was uninteresting, but because I cannot imagine what this must have been like for Marina. Basically, the Inquisition was asking all of these open-ended questions to which Marina was supposed to confess as to why they had her in custody. This seems so time-consuming on the Inquisition&amp;#8217;s part, in my opinion. I think you could get anyone to say alot of different things about why they were arrested if they did not know the actual reason! I have to imagine Marina&amp;#8217;s case was not the only instance of this happening&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think her references to spiritual encounters with Jesus, hell and being in purgatory were most likely dreams or fantasies that she had previously had, and she probably thought that someone knew about them, other than herself, so this could have possibly been a reason for her arrest in her mind. After going through nine confession sessions, of course Marina would be coming up with the most bizarre accounts of her imagination in order to explain the possible reason for her questioning. It almost seems that if you were arrested by the Inquisition, you had no hope for getting out without some sort of pentalty due to the &amp;#8220;guilty until proven innocent&amp;#8221; mentality that is backwards from today. Also, like Marina, people who were held for quite some time in cells would probably come up with some crazy things about their personal past in order to find some closure to what the Inquisition was looking for so they could be freed. I think I could go a little nuts being locked up in a cell myself. You could probably get anyone to say anything if they knew that confessing something would atleast free them from&amp;nbsp;imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this just seems too time-consuming for the Inquisition. You would think that they would just tell people what they were accused of and go from there, but I guess the point was that people would tell the truth, and even confess to other &amp;#8220;crimes&amp;#8221; without knowing the actual, real reason of their first&amp;nbsp;arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading cases like this makes me glad for our justice system of today, that&amp;#8217;s for sure! Although, because of this questionning style, it has given us very detailed accounts of actual behaviors of people during colonial times. This is probably the only positive coming from&amp;nbsp;such cases.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;It would seem logically that in a highly patriarchal society that at some point women would feel disgruntled about having to always remain submissive to men and their whims.  And what was a readily available remedy for women to calm their out-of-control husbands?  Witchcraft, of course.  Ruth Behar, in her article about witchcraft details the main reasons for women&amp;#8217;s use of witchcraft and society&amp;#8217;s reception of these supernatural&amp;nbsp;practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these societies were based in patriarchy, all members of society, women included, viewed any power that a woman might have as illegitimate and unnatural.  Society accepted and expected spousal abuse of a woman, so if a husband suddenly acquired the demeanor of a lamb towards his wife, the wife became suspect for foul play.  Behar solidly establishes that Spain and Spanish America were male-dominated&amp;nbsp;societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish viewed witchcraft very peculiarly which was as ignorance rather than heresy.  Spain had its share of heretics during its expansion; the converts from Judaism and Islam were the targets of the Inquisition.  The Spanish believed that witchcraft could be dealt with through Christian intervention.  The type of witchcraft found in Spain was a very specific kind &amp;#8212; one that revolved around love magic and sexual bewitchment.  Women used these remedies to manipulate their lovers in a number of ways:  to cause impotency for a cheating husband, subdue a violent husband, or to bring about illness.  The main method of bewitching men was through ingestion.  The &amp;#8220;magical&amp;#8221; herbs were oftentimes also mixed with the woman&amp;#8217;s bodily fluids, and when her husband would ingest this food, it was almost as if she were penetrating&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same ideals surrounding witchcraft in Spain traveled to Latin America.  Women who performed witchcraft in Latin America formed networks with each other within their neighborhoods.  Some women supplied the others with magical herbs and&amp;nbsp;plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that since witchcraft was not viewed as heretical in this area of the world that the only reason it became an issue was because of its threat to the dominance of men.  A woman in power was viewed as deviant, and even more deviant was a man in submission.  The only reason that the Church involved itself was because witchcraft was seen as an abomination on the status of a normal marriage, and at that point in time the Church had taken it upon itself to handle the rites of marriage.  I personally believe that these supernatural methods could not have worked whatsoever, so the men that happened to become &amp;#8220;bewitched&amp;#8221; probably just exposed their wives in order to get them in trouble.  Then again, after listening to some of the historical excerpts in class, people were probably ignorant enough at the time to believe that they were actually being&amp;nbsp;bewitched.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;It was interesting to look at witchcraft in the context of Latin America colonialism, because the word witchcraft conjures up images for most of us of the Salem witch trials, or of the stereotypically witch cackling over her cauldron of potions. I found it fascinating that witchcraft was actually used as a tool by women to in some way balance out the gender power system that existed at the time. Ruth Behar talks extensively of this, going into detail about how women exercised power in the private domain, yet even in the private domain it was possible to strongly influenced men in the public domain. I like how she pointed out that women&amp;#8217;s power often did not involve controlling material goods or being able to control activities, but rather was in what she termed the &amp;#8220;symbolic domain&amp;#8221;. Furthermore, despite being less obvious it was by no means trivial. Although cases of witchcraft showing interactions between two women like the Maria de la Candelaria/Michaela de Molina case we looked at did happen, witchcraft by-in-large was a method of women exerting control on&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to read how witchcraft was really not considered that big of a deal, a &amp;#8220;minor sin&amp;#8221;. I guess it&amp;#8217;s my saturation with the Salem witch trials thats gives me the idea that all witchcraft was deemed worthy of death, but I was surprised to find that the inquisitors actually dismissed the crime of witchcraft lightly. Nevertheless, a method women used to gain power was instantly labeled as harmful, perhaps mainly because it did allow women to gain some power in relation to men. It is obviously not viewed as some extreme form of heresy or sacrilege, yet society still formed a legal viewpoint against it. Once women found a way to gain power, it was instantly countered by a formation of &amp;#8220;shame&amp;#8221; associated with it. Behar aptly calls this the &amp;#8220;paradox&amp;#8221; that exists when women exercise&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martha Few discusses in some detail the fact that religion played such an essential role in gender roles of this time. Religion seems to have been a very common theme throughout all of our studies in this class, whether it be the idea of the cosmos found in southern Latin America, or the views towards war found in Mexico, or the religion the Spanish friars imposed upon the indigenous when Spain came to conquer much of Latin America. Religion can limit the practices of a society (as seen with the views towards sex) or provide opportunities for gender roles to change and shift from what they previously were. Either way, there is no doubt that religion and society are strongly intertwined throughout early Latin America&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Although the most acute judges of the witches and even the witches themselves, were convinced of the guilt of witchery, the guilt nevertheless was non-existent. It is thus with all guilt.&amp;#8221; Friedrich Nietzsche &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;A major difference between witches and psychotherapists is that witches see the mental health of women as having important political consequences.&amp;#8221; Naomi R. Goldenberg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes a witch a witch? Is it her warts, her sinister ways? Does she live by herself? Is she old or is she young? Has she buried many husbands to unknown illnesses? Why is the witch more often than not, a woman? From Western Europe to Salem, Massachusetts, our “civilized” culture has been mesmerized with the thoughts wrapping around such superstition and urban legend. Descriptions of traits and attributions do not seem to have played a great role in the pursuit of locating such evil sorcerers; nor do the articles we examined this week. Rather the only way to discover a witch was if someone accused someone else of practicing witchcraft. Does this feel like déjà vu to anyone else? Was this not the same position of the American government during the Joseph McCarthy era? How out the Stasi in Germany or the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;NKVD&lt;/span&gt; (People&amp;#8217;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs) under Stalin. &lt;br /&gt;How were these not the same tactics? According to Ruth Behar, there are numerous interconnected reasons for the different treatment of those accused of the practice of witchcraft. First, unlike it other witch hunts conducted in the United States and western Europe, these witches not only were entitled to, but also received the right for a legal defense.  Second, if found guilty of witch craft, women in Latin America underwent “religious education”, rather than the gristly torture and subsequent death that their Europeans counterparts were claimed by.  Behar also points out that unlike the Moors and Jews that were put to death by the Spanish for similar accusations, the indigenous peoples in Latin America were given great leeway because of their recent conversion and adaptation of Christianity. It should also be pointed out that the Moors and Jews were already considered either enemies or suspect of being enemies of the crown and therefore their behavior was of greater concern to the crown given their physical closeness. Additionally, witchcraft in Latin America was looked upon more as superstition by the paternal Spanish authorities; remember the indigenous people were lesser (childlike)peoples, therefore, “re-education” was the better way to promote a true understanding of their Christian conversion. &lt;br /&gt;Behar further explains that accusations of witchcraft were related to sex; examples she used were of scorned lovers, abusive or unfaithful husbands against their wife after they had fallen ill from unknown sources, etc. Behar writes extensively about what these “sorcerers” had used in their concoctions. Herbs, spells, hair and bodily fluids; yes, I did say bodily fluids. To be more specific, menstrual blood was often placed by the women in either food or drink that the man then unknowingly consumed. Though this would have made Billy Bob Thorton right at home, the idea that this was used as part of a spell obviously had serious social ramifications. Behar’s examples are of women confessing to using this tactic to gain power over their cheating or abusive husband. Men thought the blood weaken them. I am personally grossed out by this fact in a total ethnocentric viewpoint and find myself pondering what this culture would have thought (or done with) the invention of the tampon or Always maxi (heavy flow with wings). Either way, Behar’s main point was not the method that the women used, rather, the point that these women felt let down in their litigious society with regards to their personal situation. She writes that in the cases she studied, the “use of witchcraft” was as a last result when either their petition for divorce was denied or no arrest and/or punishment followed their husbands’ actions.   Witchcraft gave women a psychological edge over their mate, and appeared to do more to stop the evil infecting their husbands than the legal system provided. Behar is also quick to point out that these records mainly exist because the women felt guilty about some injury that befell their husbands and the result was a confession to gain forgiveness and cleanse them of the damages they had caused. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, Behar used great illustrations to prove her points and gives one pause to think about what they would do (or be accused of) if restitution through the legal system fails them. Too bad for me, I have had a hysterectomy… though I have been called something that rhymes with “witch” by my other half.  Maybe that is what those men were really calling their wives…&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-7545800675531624926?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;From what I gathered about early witchcraft honestly almost makes me feel bad for these women.  They were so caught up on needing love and wanting to make sure that they were not cheated on that their numerous love potions made them look incredibly selfish and needy.  I can understand the use of  &amp;#8221;love potions&amp;#8221; but lets get real.  If you were a witch don&amp;#8217;t you think you would be trying to create much more extreme potions and spells? Perhaps to fly, or to make you become invisible, or even to make you morph into other people or&amp;nbsp;objects&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I think about it this might actually show the stereotypical differences in women and men.  Women, usually considered very emotional beings were obsessed with the idea of potions for love and submissiveness. the female witches want to catch men cheating of keep them from cheating. I cannot help to think that If there were more wizards around that the spells would be physical (as mentioned&amp;nbsp;above)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I am on the same page with everyone else when it comes to punishment of witchcraft practice. Other than thinking of a cauldron and big green nose, when I hear the word witch I think of Salem witch trials and burning at the stakes. As Behar pointed out though, It was not taken this seriously in Colonial Spain.  Yes the church did take sexuality seriously and yes, these witch were incorporating sexuality into their &amp;#8220;spells&amp;#8221; but the fact is that they were just not taken seriously at all. In colonial Spain, witchcraft practice was punished with a slap on the wrist and some good old down home bible&amp;nbsp;study.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;One thing that i though was rather interesting in the discussion on witchcraft was the fact that amerindians were free from inquisitor rural.  So that they could not be the targets of blasphemy or heresy from religious courts.  Fray makes a point to state this in her introduction for the witchcraft report:  &amp;#8221;On Her Death Bed.&amp;#8221;  Fray notes that however these amerindians could still be used as witnesses for such crimes.  In the document, &amp;#8220;On Her Death Bed, Maria de la Candelaria accuses Michaela de Molina of Casting Spells&amp;#8221;  Maria de la Candelaria an indian is the accusing Michaela de Molina a mulata  and sells candy.  I would lake to note that Maria is a servant to one dona Juana.  I think this is important; on one side an indian servant gets ill and sues a mulata, who is in a higher class then indians.  Yet Maria has the help of her noble mistress and here daughter.  The only testimony brought forth in this document is that of Maria, dona Juana and her niece dona Rafaela, there was no testimony from&amp;nbsp;Michaela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the testimony from all of them stated a history between the two.  From the perspective of dona Juana and dona Rafaela the history seemed to be one involving &amp;#8220;illicit&amp;#8221; activities, one can assume sexual activities.  I would like to note on Lorenza&amp;#8217;s case.  She too had seen the same man that Maria saw and was suffered similar&amp;nbsp;symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to what was expelled from Maria, it seems, at least to my knowledge (granted Im not a doctor) rather far fetched.  Bleeding through the nose generally means heard trama, while the vomiting of rocks, charcoal, towels, hair, cigs, etc. means that Maria must have ingested these&amp;nbsp;ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing I would like to note on, ties in with what I start with; the fact that indians can not be tried for witchcraft.  Through out the testimonies two indian women were brought up, one as a known witch, still this accusation was not against&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Prior to reading Kimberly Gauderman&amp;#8217;s analysis of  the various articles centered around &amp;#8220;the nefarious sin,&amp;#8221; I had not realized that the subject of sexuality in Latin America around the colonial period has not yet been thoroughly established by historians.  Gauderman points out that some of the authors had to draw inferences from very minute details and create theoretical models from these details.  I now have a better comprehension for why topics surrounding sex and sexuality remain semi-ambiguous; the lack of concrete and complete documents to study, the gaps have to be filled very carefully and strategically.  This article further proved to me the scientific nature of history in that facts elucidated by one historian may be contradicted by another historian&amp;#8217;s findings &amp;#8212; an incident that occurs often in research fields of the natural&amp;nbsp;sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I was able to glean from this article, pulling information from the other articles, Gauderman illustrates that homosexuality to the indigenous people was framed in ambiguity as opposed to how the Spaniards viewed it.  By pointing out that sex was something that was performed and not linked to someone&amp;#8217;s identity in Nahua ideals, Gauderman concludes from Sigal&amp;#8217;s article that sexuality is a subjective creation of cultures.  Indigenous men, strangely enough, did not view the passive sexual partner as being more feminine than the active partner.  This immediately seemed strange to me because it seems natural to assume the more feminine partner would be the passive one because in heterosexual intercourse, the woman, whom is associated with femininity, is the passive partner.  Indigenous people, however, did not make this distinction.  The only reason that indigenous people began to conform to these strict norms for sexuality was to use it to their benefit to rid their towns of Spanish clerics that had infiltrated them by accusing them of sexually victimizing indigenous men.  According to Chuchiak&amp;#8217;s article, the indigenous people were quick to understand Spanish sexual&amp;nbsp;politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article also clarifies that women in fact were not passive members of society, so the active/passive and its associations with femininity can be relevant beyond the bedroom; but considering that women were given more of an active societal role, the passivity should not be immediately correlated with femininity.  In Nahua villages, women &amp;#8212; bearers of femininity &amp;#8212; played a crucial and significant societal role, so in this respect, they were by no means &amp;#8220;passive&amp;#8221; which could possibly explain why the passive partner in homosexual intercourse was not viewed as more feminine than the other.  The indigenous men did not follow the active/passive&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the luxury of having properly translated and complete Nahua articles, we as historians cannot fully understand the ideals associated with sexuality as the Nahua people practiced them.  The evidence we have available to us is accounted from the view of the Spaniards and laced both with their biases as well as our&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;For this week&amp;#8217;s post I have chosen to discuss John Chuchiak &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s article &amp;#8220;The Sins of the Fathers&amp;#8221; discussing the collision between Mayan sexual practices and those of the conquering Spanish.  I found his analysis very interesting, as he used the missionary tools used by the friars such as their vocabularies and sermons to determine the effect these teachings had on the pre-conquest Mayan ideas of sexuality. Initially he examined how pre-conquest Mayan sexual practices were more &amp;#8220;promiscuous&amp;#8221; on the surface than the system the friars attempted to impose, but in actuality the civilization had a more pure and efficient way of handling what they deemed sexually inappropriate. The advent of the Spanish actually reduced the effectiveness of the system as it muddled concepts of what was sexually appropriate, and because the Spanish system of punishment was in general more lax at following through on its rulings. This clash between two cultures sexual concepts is important to look at because as we have often discussed in class, the sexual nature of a culture represents the culture on a much broader scale, and as civilizations are often organized around the family structure the altering of sexual norms therefore alters a culture as a whole. As Chuchiak writes, &amp;#8220;all sex acts were understood in terms of their power to create, maintain, and destroy society&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;(73).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have examined all over Latin America this semester how the conquest of the Spanish resulted in the Spanish imposing their own system of beliefs onto the people they conquered. This phenomenon is seen with the Maya, where a mixing of sexual ideas occurred. Contrary to previous beliefs, the Mayans were taught that &amp;#8220;celibacy was the most desirable state and that sex was sinful and dirty&amp;#8221;. (89). It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe first of all that such a thing was being taught, and second of all that the Mayans bought into it on any level. I suppose when you&amp;#8217;re being conquered there&amp;#8217;s not much choice but to adopt the system of laws of the conquering people, but to take on such radically different views must have been extremely uncomfortable for the&amp;nbsp;Mayans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it comical that the Mayans actually used the ridiculous sexual standards imposed by the Spanish friars against them to defend themselves. We have seen select examples of indigenous people in Latin America using the invading system to their advantage (e.g. women using marriages to Spanish men for their gain), and the Mayans were able to do it. They &amp;#8220;learned well the lessons that the priests and friars taught them&amp;#8221; and then used them to attack the clergymen, who were breaking the rules they tried to impose. (99). In teaching such strict doctrine the clergymen actually condemned themselves, because the Mayans had the right to call them out when they knew they were committing sexual sin. This information is important because it shows us that the conquered people in Latin America were not always helpless when it came to their position versus the Spanish, but rather were allowed room to protect themselves using the invaders system. It thus repaints the picture of conquered society as one not where one race dominated the other completely but where rights existed on both sides. This coexistence probably strengthened even more as time went by and intermarriages between the two cultures happened, to the point where there was not longer two distinct sexual ideas clashing, but rather one mixed&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;                To me, witchcraft in the medieval times all the way through the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century conjures the image of old women standing over  the smoking black cauldrons that when discovered were quickly brought to justice either by fire or possibly drowning.  Although in many places witchcraft was seen as a threat to the community that only death could cure, in colonial Spanish America witchcraft was handled in other ways. The stereotypical version of a witch being an old poor woman did not really exist in Castile and southern Spain. Women who practiced witchcraft came from all different backgrounds and occupations. Witchcraft was not considered to be so much heresy as it was simple ignorance, so instead of putting witches in the hands of the inquisition which would have led to death, the people caught practicing witchcraft were to be educated in biblical doctrine. This then begs the question; if witchcraft is not considered heresy what threat did it&amp;nbsp;pose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                Indian and mestiza women are the most closely associated with witchcraft but this was a practice and belief that crossed both racial and social lines. There were remedies and concoctions for all kinds of things but remedies for love seemed to be the most common. Women typically made men ingest their witchcraft because as the preparers of the food it allowed easy access to a medium in which they could dispense their remedies. These remedies served many purposes. They were used to keep a lover faithful, to blind him to her affairs, to cause impotence, to spy on lovers, or even increase love. This leads us to a main threat in women practicing witchcraft; it gave women power over their husbands. Ruth Behar points out in her article that men saw this as a “larger threat to a patriarchal structure” that it turned “the world upside down by making husbands submissive to their&amp;nbsp;wives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                Though the offense was not usually punishable by death witchcraft and magic were considered sins. The church gained knowledge of these affairs through the confessionals and were generally considered the result of ignorance. The Inquisition really just desired those guilty of such deeds to feel a “sense of guilt and shame.” By denouncing people’s fears of witchcraft as mere superstition, it devalued the women’s power gained by the ability to control a lover and questioned their mental capacity. This slap in the face served its purpose in some cases, causing people to disbelieve in the power of witchcraft, while it also allowed those still inclined  to use the remedies a certain amount of freedom from&amp;nbsp;consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/boundformexico.wordpress.com/22/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=boundformexico.wordpress.com&amp;blog=11512150&amp;post=22&amp;subd=boundformexico&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt; Having read and then reread the bizarre case against Michaela de Molina in early Guatemala I must admit that I came out skeptical of the case in its entirety for several reasons.  First, however, I must describe my feelings towards Molina as well as all others involved in her strange case.  Molina herself did not appear, to me, to have the makings of a malicious character, much less a witch.  As for the others, I frankly did not find that there was sufficient written evidence to make an assessment of them.  However it was clear that Maria de la Candelaria as well as Dona Juana Gonzalez were not particularly inclined to show any favoritism towards Mullatas given their assumptions that Candelaria’s illness was the result of witchcraft practiced by Molina.  Witchcraft was, of course, the accusation brought against Molina by Dr. Don Joseph de Banos.  The alleged curse placed upon Candelaria was indeed dire causing her to expel blood, rags, soap, charcoal, and various other objects and fluids from her nostrils and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
    Delving into the details of the actual investigation, it became clear from a great deal of witness testimony that Candelaria and Molina had previously quarreled over their separate relationships with an Indian man named Pablo Vallejo.  One of these altercations erupted shortly before Candelaria birthed a child.  In the three months following the birth of this child, Candelaria suffered greatly from the various symptoms that I have already listed.  The testimony of Candelaria and her mistress Juana Gonzalez, it became evident to me, quite quickly, that they both held negatively slanted opinions of Molina.  I felt that they each suspected her as being the source of Candelaria’s symptoms (which, I should point out, are ludicrous).  However, the final testimony given by Dona Rafaela Gonzalez, the niece of  Juana Gonzalez, revealed an intriguing fact that the other two witnesses failed to mention, that being that shortly after learning of Candelaria’s sickness, Molina appeared at the house of Juana Gonzalez to apologize and cite that she was not responsible.  Rather, the one to be held accountable for Candelaria’s ailment was an Indian woman named Teresa, who was the mother of Pablo Vallejo.&lt;br /&gt;
    As for my thoughts on the case, I believe that it was largely a scheme plotted and carried out by Juana Gonzalez and Candelaria against Molina.  Firstly, it is naturally impossible for things such as soap, charcoal, and rags to spontaneously occur in one’s stomach.  Much less expel through said person’s nostrils.  However, in an age in which superstition warranted a much greater deal of authority, these were believable claims in when citing witchcraft.  I suspect the origins of the devious plan are rooted in the violent dispute between Molina and Candelaria over the Indian man,&amp;nbsp;Pablo.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div&gt;When we embarked on our discussion on witch hunts, in general but in Spanish America specifically, it did not phase me that the witch hunt specifically targeted women (perhaps this indicates how witches and witch hunts are portrayed to us as children). However, I soon began to wonder - why almost exclusively women? &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It seemed “reasonable“ that the Spanish perceived indigenous religion as demonic on account of their Catholic mission to convert. Observing communities steeped in ritual, the Spanish made the short conclusive leap to consider these rituals demonic witchcraft. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In line with Catholic tradition and related religious gender roles, stemming from Eve‘s encounter with Satan as a snake and further developed, women are considered “capricious, emotional, … something that had to be dominated, conquered, and controlled… and weak, incapable, and consequently more susceptible to diabolic temptation” (Silverblatt 176). Such a conception, reinforced within the patriarchal culture, easily lent to a gendered idea of witch as feminine. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, this distinctly gendered religious role bestowed with power (even if connected with a negative connotation) contradicts indigenous cultural gender parallelism, which characterized not only religious practices but all types of practice, public and private. This sort of parallelism is indicative of both Andean and Nahua civilizations. As such, women were not perceived as morally weak or subservient to men; instead, both men and women’s complementary contributions were considered integral to the successful accomplishment of community goals, including religion. Similarly, the notion of parallelism throughout Andean and Nahua cosmology denies the Western conception of Satan, as the singular embodiment of evil. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;So with this in mind - how and why were witches persecuted? In reading Behar, Silverblatt, and Few, the issues that arise as more interesting are the following:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;- Inquisition cases were generally initiated by members of the community and brought to the Church, meaning that the community understood the Church’s statute and embraced its tenet as commendable. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;How and why did this occur? &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Acculturation - Indigenous people originally did not accept Christianity à came to accept aspects à increasingly more aspects with increasing time and increasing hope for social mobility. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;- Actions defined as witchcraft did not necessarily run contrary to Christianity - or rather are not as I traditionally conceive as witchcraft. I was struck by the sort of cultural integration that was persecuted as witchcraft and described by Few: &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[Women] used popular religion in ways that were seen as dangerous to the colonial state. Yet popular religion was also empowering to these women, because they could use it to reshape and refabricate the “traditional” roles of women in a society structured by colonialism and patriarchy… the women’s actions were not a direct attack on church or state authority; they did not reject Catholicism or try to overthrow the state. They did, however, use religious resistance to push outward against the narrowly defined structures of their lives, creating an identity for themselves as women within colonial patriarchal structures. (p. 625)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;- Lastly, why were these “witches” persecuted? A few theories. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;To promote gendered conceptions of honor, which were also tied to class and race, as seen through Few’s cases of Dona Lorensa and Sebastiana.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Or&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;To promote the stability of the church and by extension of the state &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The Inquisition against Dona Lorensa, an elite white woman, was initiated by a mulatto slave. This demonstrates the prevalence and severity of superstition in the state and fear of how it may contribute to state instability. &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Learning about witchcraft this week, was very interesting to see how easy the human mind can be steered.  Another struggle that the women of the Latin American society had to go through.  To only be accused of witchcraft because someone does not like you, for something you did, or for the having a crazy over active imagination is scary.  If they failed the inspection to see if they were a witch, such as being able of float in a river, they could easily be sentence to death by being burned.  This is another reason why I believe that the people of Latin America must have been paranoid of always watching their backs.  It was also disturbing to learn how some women who actually practiced witchcraft, did their witchcraft, such as putting bodily fluids in their husbands food and drink.  Learning more about their ways of witchcraft practices, has me wondering, did the women actually think that it was working, them getting sick from their witchcraft.  Because if you think about it, when a wife puts something disgusting in her husband’s drink, and she sees him getting sick after the intake of bodily fluids, she may think that the practices of witchcrafts work, not realizing that the intake of others fluids can make someone ill.  If you put it in that perspective it can be true witchcraft, if the intent of the person was to make them sick, and not being guided to find out if their husband’s were cheating on them.  This could also be a way superstition in Latin America society grows.  I know that I am looking at this from a modern viewpoint and it is easy to say that people believing in witchcraft are ignorant, but maybe if I were put in their time zone I would be one who is a believer of the evils of witchcraft.  In a time of illness spreading like wildfire and not having knowledge of germs, witchcraft could be an easy reason of understanding why the evils of illness were haunting a town, when looking for answers.  One think that I like of the whole views of witchcraft, well the only thing, was that anyone female could be accused of witchcraft.  From the rich to the poor it tied the classes of the Latin American society together.  Overall it sucked for the Latin American women, and it could have made them extra scared of being called out knowing that any women no matter which class they were could have been accused of witchcraft.  One of the few things that I saw that showed Spanish leaders of Latin America had some Justice, what the fact that they allowed the idea of witchcraft in Latin America because they were new Christians.  It must have been a scary time to live in but different viewpoints slowly got us to where we are today, of trying to understand what makes each person&amp;nbsp;unique.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34;&gt;This week, our studies focused on witchcraft in colonial Mexico after the Inquisition. Ruth Behar’s article about how women used sexual witchcraft describes the ways in which women used witchcraft and why they felt they needed to use it against others.  She claims that the main reason why women used witchcraft was to reverse their subordination to men and gain some degree of control over their husbands or lovers.  The belief of magical power these women held empowered them to question and challenge the structures of inequality.  Behar notes that historians often overlook the significance of witchcraft in colonial Mexico.  However, these studies reveal important insight into the lives of women and the struggles they went through that convinced them of the need for a magical solution that would punish their oppressor(s), often without them knowing.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34;&gt;One of the main ways women administered witchcraft to their husbands was by making them eat their witchcraft.  This was considered to be the most effective and direct way to administer the spell.  One of the interesting points Behar makes about this method of administering witchcraft was that it was a way for women to “penetrate” men, so to speak, by physically putting a spell into the man’s body, in a way of reversing presumed gender notions.  Also, many men were careful not to mistreat their wives out of fear that they would “pollute” them by serving them food while they were menstruating or using witchcraft against them.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34;&gt;Spanish religious elite viewed witchcraft as a sign of ignorance, curable with instruction and punishment.  Many women, after performing an act against their husbands would feel bad and confess to the priest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34;&gt;Witchcraft did serve in breaking down class barriers between women.  Midwives and curandenas (folkhealers) were the main women that provided women from all classes with the herbs and ingredients necessary for performing a spell.  It seemed that there were women everywhere who were lurking about, waiting to hear a woman complaining about their husband or lover, ready to offer her a remedy to her problems.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34;&gt;Men were not these women’s only victims.  Women used witchcraft against other women and slaves used it on their masters to “soften” them.  These studies of witchcraft reveal a lot about the Spanish society, including their fears of women assuming power over men by means of whichcraft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4551310302796999455-4817543211816084852?l=laurenhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;1) Ruth Behar, Lots of confessions and accounts to the&amp;nbsp;courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Women are generally subordinate to men in the public sphere and any power a woman gains is considered to be negative to society or &amp;#8220;pollution&amp;#8221;. b) Spain was different than other countries in Europe when it came to Witchcraft. While other countries carried out witch hunts mostly targeting women, Spain had bigger heretics to deal with such as Islam and Judaism and did not have mass movements to take down &amp;#8220;witches&amp;#8221;. The Spanish religious elites considered witchcraft as more of stupidity and&amp;nbsp;not heresy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) Indians, Mulattas and Mestizas seemed to be the ones most accused of&amp;nbsp;witchcraft&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) Sexual witchcraft and kinds that made their men submissive to&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) Women mostly used witchcraft to gain some kind of power over&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Irene Silverblatt, first hand accounts from&amp;nbsp;letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a)  Women were seen as the inferiors in society and had no voice in politics or church and women could not own property. According to the church this made women dangerous and most likely to use evil ways to get what they&amp;nbsp;wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) Witchcraft was tied to demonic acts of the Devil and black magic and this was seen mostly done by poor and old women in the&amp;nbsp;Andes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) The devil began to take on many forms to the indigenous people of the Andes and eventually appearing as a Spaniard and things that did not mirror the image the Europeans had for the&amp;nbsp;devil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Guaman Poma,&amp;nbsp;1992&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Magic that made people fall in love or punished thieves for stealing crops and ones that punished parents for having twins, a cleft-nosed baby or if the baby was born feet first. And also magic used to cure injuries or&amp;nbsp;diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) Magicians or high Priests of the Incan&amp;nbsp;society&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) These acts don&amp;#8217;t seem to be done just by women and aren&amp;#8217;t really about control but more about helping others or punishing those who have done bad deeds. every now and then these practices were used to abuse&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Michaela de Molina,&amp;nbsp;1696&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Michaela to me seems to be just a candy seller who happened to get into a fight with the neighbor Maria and Maria got sick from the pregnancy but it also seems like she or someone else used witchcraft on her for some reason. The mistress and niece seemed kind of mean towards Michaela because of her&amp;nbsp;friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) Michaela was charged with using witchcraft on Maria because of the fight they had over the man and the witnesses only claimed that she was a witch because of the fight and the friends that she had one being a person who had already been accused of being a witch&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) I think maybe that Teresa might have used witchcraft on Maria in order to get back at her for fighting with&amp;nbsp;Michaela.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;According to Guaman Poma, it was male who officiated over the magical rituals. They were usually some sort of poison maker or the like. However, there were many different spiritual beliefs. Owls hooting at the wrong time or a wolf howling could be dark omens for the Incas. These rituals and spells might seem silly to “modern” people who believe in “reason” and “science” over superstition, but they were an active part of these people’s lives. The spells were usually utilized in such a way as to inflict punishment of some sort. This could be binding a toad and burying it in a specific location so the intended target would die in the same fashion. Or, if a thief stole a potato then the leaves of the plant would be hanged at the road to create shame within the criminal. There were also spells to allow women to punish men or allow them to punish each other through different incantations. “The demons take you,” “May you be reduced to living like a wild animal,” “May you have to be for your living or work as a servant,” “May you wander like a lost soul,” “May you starve, shrivel in the sun, go astray and die in misery as a penniless, miserable, cowardly, thieving, lousy son of a whoring mother.”  These may sound like regular insults, but the Incans believed that words had spiritual power and one could actually place a curse by saying&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is incredibly similar, and incredibly different, from the experience of witchcraft in Mexico and Spain under the Holy Mother Church. In continental Europe it was mostly women who were persecuted for their assumption of playing with the devil. These were usually single, older women who did not fit society’s standard of acceptable gender norms. Sometimes it would even be something as ridiculous as the woman having red hair. However, the incredible similarity is that both the magic in the Andes and witchcraft in Europe and Mexico were done to injure an adversarial party. This could be a cheating husband or any evil person. The spells could range from trying to make the husband impotent or killing him. One spell was to put a candle under the bed in a bucket of water, and when it went out then the husband would no longer want to have sex. The common theme throughout the literature is that magic was used to punish those that could not be punished in other ways. This is subversive because the normal social channels, the Church and civil courts, could not give the women the satisfaction they need in exacting revenge upon their mates. If anything, it is the fault of the Church for allowing this to happen because they would not kill cheating husbands. There seems to be very similar, yet definitively different, circumstance and actions between the magicians of the Andes and of&amp;nbsp;Spain/Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;One of the articles for this week, &amp;#8220;Women, Religion, and Power&amp;#8221; by Martha Few, utilized two cases of accusations of witchcraft and &amp;#8220;superstition&amp;#8221; from Inquisition records from colonial Guatemala to discuss the ways in which women used religion to exercise power over their own lives.  These two women, Lorensa de Galves and Sebastiana de la Cruz, were reported to the Inquisition after witnesses to their rituals, one a mulatta slave and the other a Catholic priest, felt that their actions were heretical in nature.  Lorensa used a ritual that involved spinning scissors in the air while invoking the twelve apostles to find out who stole several items of clothing.  The mistress of the mulatta slave discovered this ritual and disrupted it.  Sebastiana was accused of believing that her son was a son of god and had divine powers.  Specifically she and several other people had knelt in front of him while he was on a cross wearing a crown of thorns.  She also attributed to her son divine birth, saying that he had come from the&amp;nbsp;sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martha Few attributes to these actions great significance given their race, gender, and class status.  She argues that their actions were about power and the ways in which women could appropriate religious imagery and language for their own uses.  Sebastiana was a mulatta and a widow.  She used Catholic imagery in the rituals she practiced with her son and others, but in a way not sanctioned by the Church and in fact fairly heretical.  Lorensa was white and also a widow.  Her &amp;#8220;witchcraft&amp;#8221; also used Catholic imagery(the twelve apostles) but for her own uses (to find the stolen articles of clothing; which apparently she was able to do!)  Few links these actions to women&amp;#8217;s acts of resistance to the social climate of the day.  This is a novel interpretation in that both these things could just be interpreted as overly superstitious/slightly crazy women doing weird things (which is how witchcraft comes off to me!)  Few is able to re-contextualize these, to show how they make sense in a world in which women (and especially widowed women) have to justify their non-traditional actions because they lack power and&amp;nbsp;privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;I just couldn&amp;#8217;t get over this quote from Monty Python&amp;#8217;s movie, and I figured it was a good enough heading to grab some attention. Regardless, I enjoyed our discussion this past week about witches and superstitions in colonial Latin America. I have to admit that I came into the lecture thinking that the Spanish treated the &amp;#8220;witches&amp;#8221; as colonial Americans did, the infamous Salem trials in particular, but was surprised to see some major&amp;nbsp;differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruth Behar&amp;#8217;s article does perhaps the best in articulating that women who were thought to be witches were not really taken seriously. I find this interesting that the Church and Inquisition found witchcraft just a sign of &amp;#8220;ignorance&amp;#8221; but yet had such an overwhelming power over sexual practices of people during this time. Why did I bring in sexuality, though? Because as Behar expresses, women used witchcraft as a source of power, mostly through sexual relationships. So, the church was really concerned with how people were engaging and talking about sex, but yet seemed to overlook &amp;#8220;witches&amp;#8221; who were using &amp;#8220;ligatures&amp;#8221;, as Behar mentions, in which women tried to make husbands impotent. I found this a&amp;nbsp;disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Behar points out that women who were using sorcery in colonial Spain were mostly unmarried, young women or widows.  This was different that in colonial America and Europe. What struck me most though was that the idea of witchcraft among these women was in reality a means to some sort of power. As we have really elaborated on, women were much more subordinate than men in colonial Spain. The gender roles and norms were typical as women were considered more passive and domestic workers, while men were much more aggressive, to display masculinity of course, and in the public sphere in many more cases. Thus, as Ruth Behar&amp;#8217;s article articulates, witchcraft for women was not only a means of power over their husbands, but served as a community for them combining women of all&amp;nbsp;classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behar argues that the Inquisition, by ignoring withcraft as ignorance over heresy, devalued the &amp;#8220;power&amp;#8221; that women were gaining by using sorcery and magic. I had not given this connection a though before, but I find this point of view convincing in that, even though women were probably causing a scare on small, local levels of superstition, because it was not given much emphasis or attention, it was as if women were so emersed in a patriarchical society that even succumbing to magic and the devil, on some extreme cases, didn&amp;#8217;t cause for much&amp;nbsp;attention.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;When I first thought of witchcraft,I mainly just thought of people casting spells. However, witchcraft in colonial Mexico was more then just casting spells. Someone that practiced witchcraft was known to be having sex with the devil. This is one of the main reason that witchcraft was viewed as a serious sin and if found using witchcraft you would be punish severely or even be put to death.  Also witchcraft was use to make someone doing something, however during those times many people,  mainly women , use witchcraft to stop someone from doing something. For instance, some women would use witchcraft to stop their husbands from committing adulterous acts or from being abusive towards them. If a woman was having problems with her spouse, she would seek another midwife or a folk healer that would probably be formally with a remedy that could help them in in their situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was many methods that women use to executed these witchcraft method on their husbands. One of the frequent method use was to put the remedy inside the food they cook for their husbands. This was the most efficient was because the remedy could run through the man&amp;#8217;s body and work effectively. Also, Men were not the only one subject to falling a victim to witchcraft. A woman could used it against the woman her husband might was committing adultery with , or a slave could use it as well against her owner due to the fact that he was abusive towards her&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/811234197297643948-2436159732619692276?l=ras2011.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent elements of the cases that we read about this week was the comparison of homosexual relationships to traditional marriages and courtship rituals in order to define the status of the two people involved. When two men or two women went on paseo together, held hands, slept in the same bed, supported each other financially, etc., they were considered to be in a monogamous kind of physical relationship. One of the most convincing characteristics, however, was the jealous fights that couples often got into, attracting the attention of neighbors and alerting them to the fact that these two people must be involved with each other. This is still one of the ways we define relationships today. When little boys chase little girls around the playground and annoy them, their parents usually say it&amp;#8217;s because the boys like them. Later in life, if two people get into passionate arguments, particularly ones based on jealousy or similar offenses, they must be together. People tend to assume that if you don&amp;#8217;t care about someone, you won&amp;#8217;t bother to argue with them, and it won&amp;#8217;t hurt your feelings for them to give someone else attention. And usually this is true. But it&amp;#8217;s interesting to realize that fights can be a characteristic of passionate relationships. It&amp;#8217;s certainly not something we would usually assume unless we stopped to think about it. Romantic comedies almost always portray a couple who are being tormented by outside circumstances and who are also frustrating each other because of their differences and what usually turns out to be suppressed sexual tension. In fact, if I hear of a couple that never has arguments, I am usually skeptical of how sincere their relationship can be. Surely it doesn&amp;#8217;t have any depth, or they would have run into divisive issues by now. So while jealous fights and arguments are not necessarily a desirable quality in relationships, they do seem to be a widely accepted and sometimes successful measure of how intimate and sincere a relationship between two people is.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-6455829027709451670?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The colonial period in Spanish America consisted of very stringent social standards.  If these standards were compromised or if someone were accused of compromising them, then a person&amp;#8217;s honor and social standing were surely at stake.  For women, especially, a number of means existed for marring one&amp;#8217;s honor status such as pre-marital relations, marrying outside of one&amp;#8217;s social status, or even a simple insult.  In an era where sexual behaviors were heavily constrained just the accusation of such deviant behaviors could result in&amp;nbsp;imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Catarina Maria and Juan Teioa, a woman&amp;#8217;s honor was at risk because, as she claimed, her virginity was forcibly taken from her.  Analysis of the case provides clues that this claim was not veritable but was an effort to regain honor.  Oftentimes, in colonial and pre-colonial Spanish America, once pre-marital relations had occurred and a woman&amp;#8217;s virginity was lost, the man either had to promise to marry her or she could sue him for compensation for loss of virginity as a mean&amp;#8217;s of recovering her chastity.  Such was the case of Catarina Maria, whose brothers discovered her love-making with Juan, and thus probably forced her to sue him for compensation of her virginity and&amp;nbsp;honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of honor and social status became prominent once the Royal Pragmatic was installed in the late eighteenth century.  Prior to this era, the Church protected couples from the interference of their parents, but the Royal Pragmatic made it possible for parents to stop their children from marrying out of their class to preserve the standard social hierarchy.  If a woman decided she would rather marry beneath her social class she would be accused for bringing shame and dishonor to her family as well as&amp;nbsp;herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insults were also a common form of bestowing dishonor upon a woman.  In comparison to men, there were a number of slanderous terms for women such as &amp;#8220;whore&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;thief.&amp;#8221;  Being called these names were significantly more harmful than they would be in modern times because of the heavily negative connotation they carried with them due to the stigma carried with their associated sexual&amp;nbsp;acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which sexuality was constrained during this period in Spanish America created a society in which there existed several means of deviating from normal practice.  Luckily, we have available to us actual court cases which allow us to understand what principles of societal standards were of importance at this time.  The term &amp;#8220;honor&amp;#8221; still, in my opinion, remains a somewhat ambiguous term to historians, as we will never fully grasp the full impact that bearing dishonor meant to the citizens of Spanish America during the eighteenth century.  I feel that less of a double standard existed during this time as well because women and men were both faced with concerns of protecting their&amp;nbsp;honor.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div&gt;“The attempt at sexual conquest through the confessional largely failed, instead producing a hybrid sexual system that survives today in many indigenous Mesoamerican societies. Though conscious efforts by Spaniards to alter Nahua ideas of sexuality did not succeed, much change did occur as the Nahua came into daily contact with the Hispanized people….”&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This quote from Pete Sigal’s “Queer Nahuatl: Sahagun’s Faggot’s and Sodomit’s, Lesbians and Hermaphrodites” (pg. 13) summarizes so succinctly a variety of themes and forces within both pre- and colonial Mesoamerica in relation to sexual-social conquest. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I find this discussion of Spanish conquest of Nahua (and Mesoamerican more generally) culture in terms of its degree of success particularly interesting, as I recall our consideration of pre-colonial Mesoamerican civilization at the beginning of the semester. Nahua society was defined, similarly to Andean, with parallel gender relations and delineated social expectations; as such, absolutely distinct and separate economic and social roles (and also religious in most cases) existed for males and females. However, sexual roles and behaviors seem less absolutely distinct, as seen upon the arrival of the Spanish. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The Spanish, arriving in the new world both with a goal to settled an untamed land and people but also Christianize such, condemned the sexual-social behavior they found in Nahua society, referring to such with pejorative language, such as puto, sometico, xochihua, cuiloni, and patlachuia. But prior to the arrival of the Spanish, there appears no evidence (though there remains little direct historical record available) to demonstrate that Nahua penalized or condemned such behavior (Sigal 23). Indeed, it is most fascinating to consider the likelihood of such sexuality liberty in Nahua society since every other aspect of their society seemed to thrive under the operation of such binary gender-sex social relations. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, the Spanish, with a desire to impose both royal and ecclesiastical authority over the Nahua, perhaps found the greatest outlet for doing so in regulating sexual behavior. The Spanish both defined newly acceptable and unacceptable sexual roles and activities for Nahua males and females and established a system of punishment for violations of these defined acceptable standards that reinforced the authorities’ power (e.g. alcalde del barrio and la ronde).  &lt;/div&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This past week we talked about homosexuality in early Latin America and exactly how the issue was dealt with by the local authorities. During the Spanish conquests the soldiers were told to look for unusual sexual practices so there would be some kind of justification for the conquer. Immoral natives were mistreated often and the women generally raped by the soldiers. Long after the conquests the local neighborhoods had established a kind of neighborhood watch that would go around the towns, these people were referred to as &amp;#8220;Alcalde Del Barrio&amp;#8221;. The job of these individuals was to specifically look for anything illegal that the townspeople might be engaging in. Often times they would search the house of certain people based on a suspicion from another towns person that they were conducting immoral acts. We went over a few cases in class of a few individuals who were under the suspicion of having a same-sex relationship with each other. In both of the cases it seemed that a lot of the charges against them were the same generalities and often misunderstandings according to the ones being tried. In this day and age there was no &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; evidence or most of the time eyewitness accounts so the main way to get someone caught was to basically have a feeling about them. Many of these cases also happened to be brought about because a friend or family member suspected them of having a same sex relationship. We saw how the punishment for something like this could be several years working with&amp;nbsp;tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucks that many of these people were &amp;#8220;caught&amp;#8221; through word of mouth by someone who might just have a grudge against them and the evidence or lack there of could be so stacked against them. But it just goes to show just how against homosexuality the church and others were that suspicion would be enough to lock these people up. But some of the things we talked about were really disturbing that some of these people too religion to places it shouldn&amp;#8217;t go. The woman who pleasured herself to images of Jesus and all of that with the candles and whatnot was a bit odd and I couldn&amp;#8217;t imagine what the person questioning her was thinking.  However it&amp;#8217;s not surprising that religion had such big influence over people and infrastructure as it normally does throughout all of history. It&amp;#8217;s also not surprising that acts of homosexuality go back this far even though back then it might not have really been viewed in the way we know it&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;At the particular juncture in history which Martha Few deals with in her article &amp;#8220;That Monster of Nature: Gender, Sexuality, and the Medicalization of a &amp;#8216;Hermaphrodite&amp;#8217; in Late Colonial Guatemala,&amp;#8221; Western Europeans and their colonial counterparts felt themselves to be at the peak of human understanding.  Charged for the crime of double-concubinage with both a man and a woman, Juana Aguilar was brought before the court, where her sexual ambiguity became the topic of discussion, warranting further medical examination.  In order to settle the matter,  renowned physician and harbinger of Enlightenment philosophy, Narciso Esparragosa was called in to perform a medical examination on  Juana so that she could be officially categorized, allowing the court to proceed with its&amp;nbsp;ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting about this article is the belief that it was the duty and responsibility of Esparragosa, a man of science, steeped in the European tradition of the day, to scientifically determine and define Juana&amp;#8217;s gendered identity for her.  Few makes the point that Juana&amp;#8217;s own words, her opinions and emotions, are absent from the historical record, perhaps never recorded or considered at all, so that only Esparragosa, with his condescending and dehumanizing nicknames like &amp;#8220;Juana La Larga&amp;#8221; or simply &amp;#8220;La Juana,&amp;#8221; have authority in defining her body officially.  The exact power dynamics of the situation with regards to race and ethnicity are difficult to determine because Juana&amp;#8217;s is not known and while we know that Narciso moved from Venezuala to Guatemala I am not sure we know his ethnicity or how closely he was connected to the colonial power structure.  Nevertheless, I feel that this is a prime example of the Western colonizers imposition of his (and I think its safe to say &amp;#8220;his&amp;#8221; here) own values and interpretations of the world onto the colonized people, in this case&amp;nbsp;Juana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assuming a link between an enlarged clitoris and the deviant behavior of sodomy, the so-called scientific man unscientifically constructs a connection between a occurrance of the natural world, i.e. ambiguous genitalia, and a certain set of cultural behaviors, i.e. sodomy, deviance, etc.  This natural occurrence could be culturally interpreted any number of ways, yet Esparragosa and the culture from which he originates has chosen to connect hermaphroditism with a sense of abomination or deviance from nature, despite the fact that intersexuality is a natural&amp;nbsp;occurence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode can also be seen as cultural tyranny in the fact that he likens her &amp;#8220;abnormal&amp;#8221; condition to that commonly seen in Egyptian and other Eastern women.  Esparragosa&amp;#8217;s definition of normal is clearly slanted to favor the West as the yardstick by which the rest of the world is to be measured.  His treatment of Juana, particularly his repeated attempts at creating an erection in her clitoris to see if she could perform sexually as a man, but also his appropriation of her rights to self-definition and voice, are despicable, humiliating, and ultimately dehumanizing.  Some Enlightenment,&amp;nbsp;huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Our readings this week were very insightful in regards to the study of homosexuality and its acceptance, or lack thereof, in early Latin America.  I am of the opinion that, historically speaking of course, Western societies have grossly misinterpreted homosexuals and their practices.  For instance, in innumerable cases of homosexual males being persecuted for their actions authorities conducting investigations of said actions attempted to determine whom in the relationship had acted as the male figure as well as who acted as the female.  This was done so that the moral perpetrator behaving as the female may be more harshly punished, as they had knowingly committed the offense not only of homosexuality but crossing the gender lines as well, taking on the role of a woman.  This naturally was also considered a grave breach of moral codes of conduct.  Or, at the very least, this was unarguably an example of social deviance by way of gender&amp;nbsp;bending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Even today, in our much more progressive way of life in comparison to that of the early Latin Americans, the majority of people seem to be “put on edge” by those who cross our the metaphorical lines of our socially defined gender roles.  An example, if a transvestite were to walk into your classroom and sit down then, I am guessing that, most if not all of the others in the class would at the very least notice their uncommon appearance.  I am certainly not implying that such people who deviate from gender norms would be looked down upon by all, or even most of their peers.  I am simply observing that on some levels what was true in the times we are studying holds true today as well.  People from virtually all societies and backgrounds are somewhat “caught off guard” by those who cross gender boundaries.  Although that makes perfect sense, for if we did not have these norms that they are violating then we would not even have gender.  As we learned in the first days of our class, gender is an entirely social structure determined by what we come to expect of specific sexes.  When morality comes into play, the reaction to these gender-bending actions can be extremely varied, and in many cases, dire effects can be the result depending of the setting of said&amp;nbsp;actions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;Many of these cases are intriguing, though exhausted with details.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Many of the details discussed and examined in these cases included who was on top and bottom during sex, who ejaculated first into whom, their actions in public, specifically whether or not they quarreled with one another, and many other things to try and prove a couple suspected of practicing homosexuality guilty.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;It is important to note that the main force used to implicate and charge these unlawful acts was the reliance on &lt;i style=&#34;&#34;&gt;alcalde del barrio&lt;/i&gt;, a network of neighborhood surveillance “copycats”, who accused these people of committing these nefarious sins.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, in effect, snitching neighbors became the key force of enforcing sexual rule in the society.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is interesting, because these cases were almost always based on 100% circumstantial evidence of how the couple acted in public.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;What made it even harder for the accused was that there was an assumption of guilt by the court, instead of today, where the accused are always assumed innocent until proven guilty.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, essentially, if a scorned acquaintance wanted to convict someone of committing the sin of sodomy, and the accused did not have an acceptable excuse, they were guilty.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Also, in many cases, the accused were tortured until a confession was made.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I support capital punishment as a deterrent to others and a penalty to one who has committed heinous crimes; I do not think anyone would advocate severe torture as means to obtain a confession.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Any amount of logic would conclude that most confessions were proclaimed to stop the pain of being raised up by the hands while tied behind the back and other painful methods.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For instance, Zeb Tortorici writes in his article of Sodomitical Subcultures about a case in which a baker named Francisco Capiche was accused of sodomy, which he flatly denied.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, when he was interrogated and instruments of torture were introduced, he admitted to the&amp;nbsp;crime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;These two subjects are two examples of how I believe that these accused couples were wrongfully tried in court.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Even though they very well may have been practicing these unlawful acts, the way they were tried and convicted just did not seem fair in my&amp;nbsp;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition of homosexuality in colonial Latin America, specifically Mexico, and today demonstrates how the two societies have not really changed or differed, or that they have only very recently changed. In 1973, homosexuality was no longer considered a mental illness, and only in 2003 were sodomy laws struck down as “unconstitutional.” Yet, social mores still dictate that gays are less than fully equal because of the limitations on institutions like marriage and military service. Now, compare this with the “nefarious sin against nature.” Homosexuals were routinely tortured to procure confessions (because confessions were not considered legitimate otherwise) and sentenced to death (the prescription was fire like Sodom and Gomorrah, who were punished for their despicable sexual acts). The question arises about whether or not this is an evolution of ideas or the descent into moral&amp;nbsp;chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the case of Cuyne and Quini people can see how there was widespread discrimination and bias against homosexuals by the Holy Mother Church, an institution that normally preaches tolerance and love for others. The men were caught in a sexual act together, which led to interrogation of them. The interrogation led to several different names and eventually six prosecutions. The article “Sodomitical Subculture” by Zeb Tortorici writes about the case in excruciating details, even saying every time the guys ejaculated into the anuses of their sexual mates. However, the more important part is that every time a sexual act was discussed, they said who acted the part of the man and who acted the part of the woman (meaning the “woman” was penetrated by the “man”). This “woman” was punished more severely because they had violated the natural gender roles. Men were not supposed to be dominated, and by doing so they violated nature even more than just having sex with someone of the same&amp;nbsp;sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all comes back to the question about whether or not this is an evolution of ideas or the descent into moral chaos because social order will have been abrogated when men and women no longer fill their proper gender roles. Or this is at least the argument moralists within the Church would use because order must prevail. By allowing men to act as women and women as men the order of society will be undermined and proper social control cannot be implemented. Men and woman should, according to the conservative commentator, be who they are supposed to be. Not ironically, this means the men going to work and “bringing home the bacon,” while the woman cooks, cleans, and tends to the children. Therefore, if order is to prevail, both men and women should re-establish their former roles, or new ones need to be implemented to make sure order is&amp;nbsp;established.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I chose to focus this blog on the article by Laura A. Lewis titled &amp;#8220;From Sodomy to Superstitution: The Active Pathic and Bodily Transgressions in New Spain.&amp;#8221; Homosexuality and our recent discussions of the cases presented by Dr. Black in class have been quite interesting to me, and so I really wanted to read more about similar accounts, hence my focus on Lewis. Although Lewis dove into many topics, I found myself drawn to the female cross-dressing cases. According to Lewis, male homosexuality was punishable  by death, but the stereotypical comparison to &amp;#8220;sodomites&amp;#8221; as &amp;#8220;passive&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;acting like women&amp;#8221; and even dressing like one were not in and of themselves punishable by death. However, I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but notice how much male homosexuality was condemned just by it being an act of feminization of men. Of course, that would be looked down upon for a man to have female characteristics, and I think we all can agree that this idea was consistent with colonial times, as women were usually&amp;nbsp;subordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Lewis provides accounts of females who dressed as men.  She also notes a difference here in that females who dressed and acted like men were not immediately thought of as homosexual, unlike men who dressed as women. She goes on to say that this goes back to females being subordinate, so to become more like a man, although deviating from gender norms, a woman wasn&amp;#8217;t looked down upon taking up male characteristics. I think that these notions are still around today! I would argue that women have much more fluidity when it comes to dressing more masculine or taking up masculine characteristics/interests. The question for me is, although one could argue that this is still because feminine qualities are subordinate to masculine ones, isn&amp;#8217;t the gap between acting more feminine or masculine less deviant than colonial Spain? I would think so, however, as a female, I&amp;#8217;m still pretty confident that I could get away with dressing more masculine, then let&amp;#8217;s say, my brother dressing feminine. These gender roles of dress and their links to homosexuality seem to have some deep historical roots that we are learning from Lewis&amp;#8217; and others case&amp;nbsp;studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewis also mentions the church attire, which consisted of capes and cloaks, etc. This style of dress seems much more androgynous, although there were distinctions between male and female. I find this interesting considering that the church was so strict and very concerned with sexual practices and gender roles among society, even down to dress. Regardless, I can say with confidence that I am glad to be a part of a time where fluidity among sexual preferences and practices is much less condemned than previous ones. I can&amp;#8217;t imagine the fear instilled in those by the church who were conducting these acts, in particular homosexual ones, considering their very lives were at&amp;nbsp;stake.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history465/blog/intersexed-individuals-and-colonial-medical-knowledge.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;In Martha Few&amp;#8217;s article &amp;#8220;That Monster of Nature&amp;#8221; she details the case of an intersexed person in late colonial Guatemala, Juana Aguilar, who was charged with double concubinage (unmarried living with a man and a woman).  Juana is revealed to be intersexed, then described using the term hermaphrodite.  A physician is called in to examine Juana after Juana has been examined by midwives and lay surgeons.  This physician, Narciso Esparragosa, attempts to debunk the declaration that Juana is a hermaphrodite.  Instead of being both &amp;#8220;man and woman&amp;#8221; Juana is &amp;#8220;neither man nor woman&amp;#8221;.  He comes to this conclusion after examining Juana&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;genitalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that it was interesting that Esparragosa defines Juana as &amp;#8220;neither man nor woman&amp;#8221; which is of course what intersexed people are.  Esparragosa has an oddly advanced attitude toward what we know as intersexuality.  However, in other ways his attitude is very chauvinist.  He believes, for example, that Juana&amp;#8217;s enlarged clitoris would lead her to be more &amp;#8220;lascivious&amp;#8221; than a woman with a smaller clitoris.  It was funny/sad/racist that he claims that &amp;#8220;Egyptian&amp;#8221; women typically have larger clitorises, and provides a justification for female genital mutilation.  He claims it is a &amp;#8220;necessity&amp;#8221; to maintain honor.  Esparragosa also assumes that there is some legitimate standard to judge what a nomral clitoris (and male genitalia) looks like. His arrogance is&amp;nbsp;astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really can&amp;#8217;t imagine what it must have been like for Juana. They charge her with a crime, have her examined by any number of experts, and then hire Esparragosa to write a report about her.  His report is published in a newspaper even.  Also, during his examination he attempts to stimulate her to find out if she is able to have sex as a &amp;#8220;man&amp;#8221; which is really quite disturbing.  Juana is even given a nickname &amp;#8220;Juana La Larga&amp;#8221; which means &amp;#8220;Long Juana&amp;#8221;.  While all this is going on, I&amp;#8217;m sure that she was struggling with her own feelings about her sexuality and gender.  I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned before the Argentinian film &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;XXY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; about an intersexed individual Alex who also has a less than ideal interface with the medical establishment.  I think I will never understand why people have a strong aversion to accepting that everything is a little more complicated and unknowable (especially something as complicated as sexuality and gender) than we would like to&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Normally when I think of law practices in the 1700&amp;#8217;s, I assume they were biased, unfair, and primitive. The negative connotations of the Inquisition and the role of the church in the trial and punishment of criminals makes it seem like the system must be corrupt. So I was somewhat surprised by the cases that we read of sexual crimes in colonial Mexico. Particularly the case of Catarina Maria and Juan Teioa. The complexities of the record and what actually took place in the proceedings reminded me of Law and Order or another of the crime shows that are so popular on television today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the reason that these shows are so popular is that they have complex plots and mysterious outcomes, and at the same time show us a lot about our society and the way that different people act within it. Sometimes they display people that are considered &amp;#8220;different&amp;#8221; or outside of the normal confines of society, but often they tell stories of people that seem perfectly normal but have terrible experiences that cannot be explained without extensive investigation and exploration. The Latin American crime records are no different, containing information about the way things worked on a regular basis and what happened when someone came forward who did not fit with the typical attitude and structure of society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first important piece of information to be noted in this case is that the primary players are all Indians. Catarina Maria was an Indian woman, but was able to file a complaint on her own, without a father or brother doing it on her behalf. Juan, similarly, was given equal rights of trial and access to lawyers. His sister, also an Indian, was the most powerful witness in the case, and could give her testimony without corroboration from a man or a Spaniard. These facts alone show the law system to be less unfair than I would have assumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of these people seems just as complicated as a television episode as well. Catarina accuses Juan of rape, he claims she seduced him, his sister corroborates the point, other people discuss her sexual exploits in the past&amp;#8230; And all of these revelations take place within the system of the courts, through formal testimony and documented statements. Certainly this goes beyond the quick, biased condemnations that are most often associated with the period. In doing show, it gives us evidence for looking at the motivations of people during this time, which were often no different than the desires that motivate people today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, we can ask what Catarina Maria&amp;#8217;s motivations were for turning Juan in. Her primary witness, she claimed, was Juan&amp;#8217;s sister, who ended up testifying against her by relating the contents of her love letters to Juan. Surely she would have known what the sister would say. Perhaps when her family discovered that she was no longer a virgin she accused Juan of rape to throw the blame off of herself, and they encouraged her to press charges. Regardless of her reasoning, the complexity of the case shows that women involved in sexual crimes in the colonial period were not just either an innocent victim or a whore, but could have complicated relationships which affected their sentencing in court.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-2190155517874243170?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;it&amp;#8217;s no surprise to me that the church would try to say what is acceptable and what is not. Even today churches have rules based on scripture in most cases of what is appropriate for the average family. What we have here is that a marriage must be 1) consensual 2) procreative and 3) unadventurous as set by the church. It&amp;#8217;s obviously important that the marriage was consented by both parties and not forced. It was important for family to be able to procreate because bigger families usually meant more work got done and also more children to carry on the family name if they were male. Last but not least a couple must be unadventurous which I assume means be boring and do the same thing over and over again. Now I can understand why the church wags its finger at many of the items on the lust list but I never got why masturbation is a sin. I haven&amp;#8217;t read the bible or anything and if anyone has an answer for that let me know. But the rest I can see as bad, sex for pure pleasure I can see as wrong, adultery obviously. Incest has always been a big no no except for in monarchies where it&amp;#8217;s been encouraged. Rape is wrong no matter what and should be punished now abduction is sketchy. One person could say that they were kidnapped but I know that some were probably happy to get away from their lives to be with someone they loved.  I went over my confusion about masturbation but I can surely understand sodomy and bestiality. The church is often seen to many as the role model for everything good and we always lash out when they mess up but people forget that the church is run by humans and temptation gets the best of all humans from time to time. So these rules are set in place to keep people from straying down the wrong path or at least to remind people to be good citizens. Nowadays I don&amp;#8217;t see that unadventurous thing flying and I think that if a couple is happily married that as long as things are kept within reason that they should be able to expand their love making beyond the simple and&amp;nbsp;boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my honest opinion though all these rules can also backfire on the ones that put them in place. I know from observing others and reading news that when rules are strictly enforced that many times it just makes people want to break them just to experience what was so forbidden. So I understand why the church during these times had rules like this in place but I also understand why many acted out against&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;According to the law in Colonial Mexico, sex was to be consensual, unadventurous, and only done for the purposes of procreation. Sure, being consensual is important but use of the term “unadventurous” and limiting its purpose to procreation, gave rise to the possibility of all sorts of “sexual sins” that many people seemed perfectly at liberty to violate. There were seven basic manifestations of these sins, that if one were caught participating in could then be prosecuted and punished. The Catholic Church supposedly was the tool of social control in colonial Mexico, according to Lavrin’s article, “Sexuality in Colonial Mexico: A Church Dilemma,” but the church’s ability to impose social controls especially concerning  sexuality comes into question based on the large number of illegitimate children and numerous court cases involving  what the church had deemed “sexual&amp;nbsp;sins.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strict morality code was vamped up in response to “humanists, freethinkers, and protestants,” in the Council of Trent, but the trouble lay in the cultural and societal norms that already existed, that, and the reality that it was difficult to catch and then subsequently prove that people had been involved in sexual sins. The Church’s difficult task was in resolving the seemingly large discrepancy between the rules and code of behavior given on acceptable sexual practices and the actual conduct of people. The task was given to the priests and local bishops who used confessionals as a main tool in learning about the people’s “sins” and then, in theory at least, the priest would guide them toward a more holy lifestyle. Once again however, in reality the priests themselves did not heed the constraints and control their&amp;nbsp;behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strict moral codes, that were basically ignored by many people until it served their purposes there are a surprising number of court cases involving sexual sins that were punished by jail sentences and fines depending on the severity of the crime. It seemed anyone could file a case with the court whether it be a husband who believes his wife is participating in an adulterous affair or an Indian woman accusing a man of rape. The court took each case and investigated with equal fervor, in order to find out the truth and punish the offender. The court cases themselves often demonstrated the lack of attention given to the church’s strict definition of sexual purity. It was more likely that a person would be punished or brought to court because an opposing party felt hurt, betrayed, or knew they might get something out of it than any moral&amp;nbsp;obligation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Hello everybody and sad day of the vols!  Well I have learned many new things this week about what was acceptable sexual practices in Mexico.  For the people of Latin America, well for the ones who followed the churches rules, it must have been hard to know how and why the rules were so harsh, such as the women always being on the bottom during sex.  It&amp;#8217;s a bit hard to follow all the rules, such as the seven sins of lust, but it is a lot simpler to know the one rule of man on top women on bottom in a bed and only to try to create a baby.  It&amp;#8217;s funny that they have to point out all the other sexual practices they cannot do.  It is also a bit odd to me that they have different levels of sexual crimes like stand up sex is worse than man on bottom and women on top.  It also must have been scary sneaking around and always having to worry about getting caught for not following the rules of sex, especially if one could have been killed for a sex crime, such as a husband catching his wife in bed with another person and having every right to kill both of them out of anger! It was very interesting reading all the case studies on sexual crime.  Most of these crime logs show that honor was a big deal, and crime of sex was a good way to tant someone&amp;#8217;s reputation or even their family&amp;#8217;s reputation.  Such as in Catalina&amp;#8217;s crime log, because her brother testified for her in a good way, even when it was known that she had sent many love letters to Juan.  It seems that her bother could have even more of an interest for not only his sister, but of his own and entire family.  Although all these case studies seem a bit crazy to me and many others, I have to stop back and look at our own ways of slander in 2010, and overall it has not changed to much, when people want to slander someone they go straight to the slut or fag and it can be a low blow to someone&amp;#8217;s feelings.  One of the major differences of today and the time of early Latin America is that we do not go to court for simple sexual crimes, like sex before marriage.  I can imagine that people at that time must have been nicer to one another, because if they get into an argument and one person want them to get into trouble, they could have gone to the church and said that that person was unfaithful to the sexual rules and sent them to prison.  I am happy to see that if they were caught lying they themselves could be sent to jail, but only if&amp;nbsp;caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/utayala10.wordpress.com/17/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=utayala10.wordpress.com&amp;blog=11615662&amp;post=17&amp;subd=utayala10&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Obviously I wouldn&amp;#8217;t expect anyone in our class to be surprised by the fact that the Roman Catholic Church has notoriety for a history of placing strict moral standards on the behavior of its members.  However, I hope that I am not alone in thinking that, based on our readings, this practice got completely out of hand.  The sheer amount of rules and expectations held by the church was absolutely ludicrous.  Naturally, marriage was to be expected when setting basic guidelines for a Catholic person&amp;#8217;s sex life.  But the extent to which many other facets were monitored and controlled was simply&amp;nbsp;outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many basic principles that were held in early Spanish America regarding acceptable circumstances for wedlock are still practiced by an extensive number of modern Catholics (or at least that is what I understand as a non Catholic).  Regardless it is reasonable that some Christian dictums of past eras are taught with far less emphasis.  For instance, I personally find it absurd to measure sin in a multitude of very basic human actions that are largely uncontrollable.  As the article by Larvin pointed out, it was considered a sinful act to enjoy the memory of a past &amp;#8220;wet dream,&amp;#8221; or even to enjoy it as it happened!  The absurdity of finding sin in human thought also extended to a person&amp;#8217;s sexual fantasies and desires.  Frankly, I have always been under the impression that, as hard as we as human beings may try, we are basically incapable of deciding what comes to our heads as well as what we find pleasure and enjoyment in.  Both of these were measured and judged in the eyes of the church.  Whats more, the church systematically utilized the confessional as a tool to monitor such minor elements of behavior as a means of gathering intelligence and&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the church practically mapped out the moral course of sexuality for all peoples by setting such a vast number of rules to be followed.  Masturbation, for instance, was completely out of the question due to the fact that it was an unholy &amp;#8220;waste of seed.&amp;#8221;  Sex within marriage also came with many moral stipulations and limitations.  Couples were strictly forbidden to be &amp;#8220;adventurous,&amp;#8221; a rule which I find ridiculous because there is no real way of morally measuring that.  Sodomy was forbidden, as was any kind of sexual behavior that was not a procreative form.  Going back to the theme of crimes of thought, it was also considered sinful to think of anyone besides your spouse during intercourse.  The metaphorical window of opportunity was pretty small for those intending to meet these moral&amp;nbsp;quotas.&lt;/p&gt;

The Church had strict guidelines regarding the most intimate details of married couples’ sex lives.  The standard acceptable template laid out three overlying rules for sex.  First, sex must be consensual.  We learned about this aspect in last week’s class and by reading about it in Patricia Seed’s book.  Marriage must be between two consenting adults, who married on their own free will, and not of their parents’.  The second was that sex should only happen with the sole purpose being to procreate.  The third rule was that sex should be unadventurous.  If the sex was enjoyable and not purposeful and to the point, the couple had committed a sexual sin in the eyes of God (i.e. the Church).  This rule is hard to understand viewing it in today’s eyes where just the opposite is the case.  It seems like today, the number one reason/goal of sex is for enjoyment and the second, or “side effect” of sex is procreative.  Of course these rules seem unrealistic and I wonder just how many couples obeyed them in the intimacy and privacy of their homes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34;&gt;In our discussion groups, we discussed the court cases brought before the Church involving sexual sins.  My group discussed the deflowering of Maria by Juan.  In our eyes, this was just one example of how easily women claimed sex as a reason to sue a man over “lost virginity” and honor.  Although it did not work out quite as Maria and her family had wished.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: georgia; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34;&gt;This week’s lecture and discussion topics were probably the most interesting materials so far this semester.  It is so interesting to see the strict values the church hold the people to at the time and the court cases that result with those preconceived values.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4551310302796999455-2449342527809618596?l=laurenhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The Holy Mother Church , in her infinite wisdom, deduced that there were different types of sexual sins, and then the state and ecclesiastical courts enforced them. These sins included fornication, adultery, incest, rape, abduction, sins against nature, and sacrilege. The typical, liberal-minded modernist will argue that it does not matter what the Church taught and that they were intolerant. Furthermore, they will argue that it is wrong to punish those immoral against like sex between unmarried people and sodomy by homosexuals. However, they fail to see that we do the same thing in the modern context of today. Every culture needs taboos and mores to create a stable, ordered society. If moral relativism was allowed to run rampant, then anyone could do anything and chaos would lay waste. Efficiency would be abolished and society would crumble at the feet of history. In America, child molestation, incest, rape, adultery, and abduction are still viewed negatively and punishable by law, except adultery. This is because moral standards are necessary for a functioning nation or community. Here is where the critic will admit that morals are necessary, but that they should not be punished in either ecclesiastical or civil courts. However, our readings demonstrate the very valid need of this to&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the case of Catarina Maria and her lover, Juan Teioa, one sees the necessity of the courts. Colonial Mexicans possessed certain ideas of honor, which was a socially constructed concept. However, it was important to them none the less. Catarina was caught having illicit sexual relations with Juan and eventually her brother forced (at least this is my conclusion from the case) to file charges against the man she loved. They said that Juan “forcibly” deflowered (took her virginity) Catarina. If the courts had not been available, the brothers could merely have cried “rape” and Juan Teioa’s honor would have been tarnished forever. Yet, the courts were able to determine that the two of them had made love, which was admitted, though the courts said it was consensual. Juan Teioa’s sister actually transmitted love letters between the two. There were witnesses to support Juan’s story. The truth was came out (so to speak). If civil courts had not interfered in matters of morality then Catarina’s false, malicious accusations would have hurt Juan forever because once honor is lost, it can never be regained. This might be difficult to translate into today’s world, but there is ample evidence to show that morals should be upheld by the courts to protect society and the community as a whole, especially when the subject of “honor” is raised in Colonial and today’s society. Though, instead of “honor,” it is reputation that is being protected. The courts help save the reputation and honor of the accusers and the&amp;nbsp;accused.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;In discussing the development of strict and overt regulation of sexual practices by the Church and by the state, I was struck by the complementary relationship between the Church and state, one seemingly embraced both by authorities in both sectors and in some instances by the governed population. I found this most curious, having been raised under a governmental system that preaches the glories of separation between church and state (though not necessarily practicing such).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As seen in analyzing Spanish and Spanish-American societies around the seventeenth century with regard to policies concerning sex and sexuality, one can clearly see that the church had a guiding hand in the creation of state policy, which is not wholly dissimilar modern American policies aimed at sexuality. One must ask the purpose for such interference – purposeful or inadvertent – does the state seek to promote a universal morality with regards to sexual behavior or does the state hope to promote stability by prohibiting certain behaviors of lifestyles that may be correlated to “high-risk tendencies”?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the primary sources we have read, particularly when considering the legal documents, demonstrate an interesting socio-political dynamic – every person (of every race and social class) is granted legal rights, but those rights seem to be exercised with different frequency and purpose with great connection to said person’s conception of honor, based on his or her race and social class. This dynamic would of course remain, and perhaps even be more pertinent, when discussing regulation of sexual activities, as such were directly tied to both men and women’s sense of honor across social class boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course in the “modern” world, we live in a different place and time, influenced by many more ideas and forces; however, parallel laws exist today in our county, our state that highlight the continuing influence of the church on state policy - and not only that, but state policy that dictates the proper and acceptable behavior in which to engage sexually  and further with whom. I have seen – and with this study further see – this as a complete invasion of privacy and am baffled at the viability of this law.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-3856053958741919782?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I found our discussions concerning sexuality and the church this past week some of the most interesting of the semester. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because the church still plays some sort of role in determining sexual behavior, or atleast has historical roots in what society deems as acceptable or not. However, I am focusing on Lavrin&amp;#8217;s article concerning sexuality in colonial Mexico because it seemed to really develop deeper into the discussions we had from class this past week, and I also noted some findings that really stuck&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, courtship really stood out during this time period! Lavrin dives into how men and women sexual relations were understood through courting practices.  Men went to great lengths to &amp;#8220;woo&amp;#8221; ,as Lavrin put it, their woman by gift-giving and verbal promises to a future of marriage. Interestingly, these courtships seemed to last for some time, and premarital sex definitely occurred, especially if the future promise of marriage was apparent. It&amp;#8217;s as if even though actual marriage had yet to occur, the promise of it was enough justification for sex. Here again, the protection of female chastity emerged in courtships, as Lavrin really emphasizes how women somehow made themselves more attractive by turning down sexual practices until marriage. For men, not acting on or suggesting any sexual practices helped women trust that they sought her hand in marriage during a courtship, not simply just for lust. Regardless, these courtships seem very indicative of this time period. In fact, as I was reading about it, I wondered whatever happened to&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the church had alot to say about sexual practices, even though actual human behavior wasn&amp;#8217;t as ideal. Today, however, courting or &amp;#8220;dating&amp;#8221; seems to be a lost art. Is this because the church has less &amp;#8220;control&amp;#8221; over personal relationships between men and women, or could it be because social interaction in relationships have just changed? Not that I want the church to be so strict as to force a reappearance of courting, but sometimes I think the dating life today would be nice with it. People are either &amp;#8220;going out&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;not&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;.but they&amp;#8217;re actually &amp;#8220;not going anywhere&amp;#8221;! I find this sort of&amp;nbsp;humorous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other interesting bit that I felt Lavrin developed upon was again the strict ruling of the church, through mostly confessionals over sexual practice. Even dreaming or thinking about sex was a sin! I can only imagine the constant anxiety of waking up in the morning after some sexual dream wondering if a confession would have to occur to keep the soul saved. These poor people couldn&amp;#8217;t control every biological sense of themselves! The church had alot to say about human behavior, even innate behavior, so it&amp;#8217;s not as surprising that actual practices deviated from these unrealistic &amp;#8220;ideal&amp;#8221; notions. I think the church had good intentions of the sanctity of marriage and the sinfulness of adultery, incest, etc. However, some extremes seemed to infringe upon a person&amp;#8217;s own humanity. Here I go again being biased and not thinking about this on a contextual level for the time&amp;nbsp;period&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me recap, Lavrin&amp;#8217;s article helped me understand how the tension between the church and human sexuality played out during the colonial period. I also have a new wish of the revival of courtship, but am not getting my hopes&amp;nbsp;up!&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The Lavrin article we read this week, &amp;#8220;Sexuality in Colonial Mexico: A Church Dilemma&amp;#8221;, details the Catholic Churches rules and methods for enforcing a prescribed sexuality.  The Church made rules for who one could have sex with, how one could perform that sex, and the crux of the first two, who one could marry.  Sex was for married people, and married people were people who weren&amp;#8217;t too closely related and whose parents didn&amp;#8217;t object.  The sex these married people had was pretty muc limited to procreative sex.  In other words, the boring stuff.  The Church uses the confessional and its discipline as the main tool to enforce these&amp;nbsp;rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lavrin says, &amp;#8220;There was always a gap between religious canons and the actual behavior of the people.&amp;#8221;(48)  Lavrin uses Church records to prove this explicitly.  It makes me wonder then, why make rules no one can/will follow?  Especially rules around something like sex, something so much more tied to really basic drives than say silver mining or something like that.  The Church tried to create tight definitions around sex and gender that people persistently broke through.  It seems like the solution would be to make rules that people agree upon, and that they can follow.  The Church apparently didn&amp;#8217;t think so, maybe because god gave them infallibility. It made both masturbation and non-marital sex a sin.  People are going to do one or other, and yet they are both a sin.  Makes absolutely no sense.  It made being queer a sin, and yet us queers kept on sinning.  Makes no sense.  The Church apparently had little to no understanding of humanity, despite being composed entirely of&amp;nbsp;humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This week we delved into an examination of sexuality and society, particularly the societal control on sexuality that was present in early Latin America.  This week for me pieced together several of the topics we&amp;#8217;ve been looking at lately (marriage, the Church, family) and gave some good insight into what &amp;#8220;sin&amp;#8221; was defined as in this era. It was interesting to see how the Church exerted and enforced its views on marriage and sex, and by doing so shaped the framework of society (because society is built around what the family is defined as). Using the confessional as surveillance was perfect for maintaining a grasp on society, as clergy could utilize the threat of eternal damnation to draw out any necessary information about private sexual practices. It&amp;#8217;s interesting to consider what marriage was supposed to be: consensual, procreative, and unadventurous. After understanding that it&amp;#8217;s much easier to understand how sexual sin came to include so many&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday we examined a few court cases, which were enlightening both for giving insight into how the courts came to a decision and for providing secondary or peripheral information. For example, most groups looked at the Catarina Maria &amp;#8220;deflowering&amp;#8221; case, which showed not only the aspects of sexuality in Latin American culture, but also gave peripheral information&amp;#8211;women had legal rights, honor was highly important, and loss of virginity had legal implications.  Another case emphasized the extreme importance of will in marriage. The annulment suit between Diego Andres and Ysabel Suyo provided an example of something that was discussed a week or two ago in this class&amp;#8211;the fact that a marriage could be annulled if it was proven that both parties had not consented using free will to it. In this case the judge ruled that Ysabel did not have free will, and thus the marriage was annulled. Once again this shows that women had legal rights at this time, and that marriage could not be forced. I see a lot of similarities between the legal processes of this time and ours. The two parties involved were allowed to present witnesses and testimonies, and had a chance to provide evidence for their innocence or the other person&amp;#8217;s guilt. The decision is made by one person, of course, but other than that the way this culture went about resolving legal issues is not too distant from processes seen in many countries today. The subject matter is somewhat different because societal norms and values are different, but through these cases its possible to get a good glimpse of what was valued in this&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always interesting observing how a society changes as its attitude towards the religion changes. Right now we are studying a society where the Church exerts a great amount of control. As the Patricia Seed we read for last week demonstrated, though, a change in the role of the Church correlates with changing values of society. When there is separation of church and state, as in America today, there seems to be a wide variety of value systems, but when religion plays a huge role in defining what is legal or illegal, there is much less variance of value&amp;nbsp;systems.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;To Love, honor and Obey In Colonial Mexico&lt;/em&gt;, Patricia Seed does an excellent job of using church, and secular laws as well as literature produced during the time period to argue about the cultural change in the ways engagements and marriages happened in from the early sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Seed further informs us that the change of society, especially with regards to the younger generation is what drives the church to take its position against both the parents and secular law; even though it was not known for its advocacy with regards to freedom of choice within the church’s own tenants. Unfortunately, I would have to argue with Seed at this point. I found her book to leave the unanswered question as to the real motives behind the Catholic Church. Seed argues that Capitalism is what ultimately changed the cultural context of marriage; with regards to the economic reasoning behind the cycle of parentally arranged marriage to choice by the couple and ultimately back to parental influence. However, Seed fails to apply and investigate the church’s influence by the raise in a capitalist market. In my opinion, the Catholic Church changed its position on free will for marriage purposes only, in order to retain its financial dependency and political control of these newly made couples, which thereby gave the church a new monetary basis for its own benefit and reinforcement of the church’s tenets of marriage that restricted the wives rights under both the secular and moral laws. &lt;br /&gt;What exactly do I mean? It’s very simple. With the boom of Adam Smith type Capitalism, citizens looked to the government authority to regulate their lives and began ignoring the inflexible nature of the church; in other words, the church was not making anyone money, therefore, financial influence began pouring into the pockets of politicians rather than the church’s. Families were worried about the implications that came along with the intermarriage of their children, which began overshadowing the former tenets of ideology with regards to social beliefs such as “honor”. Honor became a commodity, which one could purchase for the right amount and social status quickly followed.  Families began to arrange marriages for their children based on how their marriages could bring an economic addition to said families. For example, when my husband told his parents that he had asked me to marry him, his parents went nuts, worrying over what his “family” assets were, how I would affect the will of his grandparents, and that since my father was a mere painter, there was no financial incentive for his father, etc. Prenuptials were threatened by my father-in-law.  They even went so far as to try and set up my husband with one of his third (or fourth) cousin who would sign anything the family told her too (incidentally, his parents either did not know or cared less that this same female was gay). Why? To protect their “family interests” (further explains my in-laws interest in my divorce, does it not?).  &lt;br /&gt;It is obvious to see that children, no matter what time period they live in, will rebel against their parent’s authority. The church, however, saw this period as an opportunity. Seed implies that it changed because of the romantic influence of the Renaissance, but I again disagree. I think they saw it as a way to reassert itself into the political sphere and to gain a new basis to collect tithes from. After all, this younger generation would obviously be having sex (since they choose their mate) and they would produce offspring (so long as they went by the church’s prescribed tenets), and therefore the church would gain two probably generations to pilfer its existence off of.  Pretty sweet deal if you were the church, pretty rotten if you were the female or the female offspring. Why? Because the church began to infiltrate everyday life; regulating sexual practices, even within the bounds of marriage, fortifying its patriarchal gender roles, which reinforced inheritance laws that took away a woman ability to govern herself. &lt;br /&gt;For the freedom of being able to choose their spouse, women traded their former economic freedom with regards to inheritance and financial compensation for broken engagements, and handed down to their daughters and granddaughters the legacy of prescribed gender roles and assignments, enforced and regulated by the Catholic church, with less economic and legal rights then previously given prior to the idea of “free choice to marry any fool you want to with the blessing of the Catholic Church”. &lt;br /&gt;Less Shakespeare and Cervantes, more Adam Smith based rhetoric next time Ms. Seed…&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-7617711553914980032?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Patricia Seed&amp;#8217;s description of love in the colonial period reveals the heart and soul of their views of marriage and the way it changed. While in modern times we might think that love was not a factor in marriage several centuries ago, people at the time thought that love was extremely important, they just had a different concept of what love meant. It was inextricable with notions of honor and duty, and was tied to family obligations and expectations as well as individual emotion and desire. Furthermore, it effected the way that marriage relationships played out and the way that marriages were arranged to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early colonial period, when colonial society in Latin America was more focused on religion, marriage was most importantly seen as a form of honor and obedience to God. They were granted by the church and governed by the church, eventually becoming one of the Sacraments. Since a marriage was then involved in individual salvation, ideally both partners would be more committed to the guidelines for a successful union. The role that love played at that time was to validate the spiritual nature of a marriage and add to its religious justification. Spouses were instructed to love one another, and this love was displayed through an intentional commitment to the longevity of the marriage and pleasing one&amp;#8217;s partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Love&amp;#8221; remained a commitment even as marriage became more secularized. As wealth grew increasingly important to citizens of the Latin American colonies, unions were more commonly based on the union of finances and monetary holdings, instead of mutual acceptance and similarities in class and temperament. The state also took a lot of power away from the church, and the government now granted marriages and oversaw conflicts within them. However, love was still seen as important if the union were to survive, and it was thought to be shown through the responsibilities of a husband and wife. If a man upheld his honor by providing his wife with a comfortable life and protecting her reputation, that was a sign of his love for her. The love of a woman was displayed through faithfulness and the tasks that she performed within the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, an honorable couple, whether joined by religious or financial concerns, would commit to love one another and grow more affectionate towards each other over time. The unions were not based on fleeting emotions or feelings that would not stand the trials of married life, but on an understood agreement that was to last a lifetime. Of course problems within marriages were still as numerous as they are today. People were not always content with their marriage partners, even if they had a positive opinion of their partner in the beginning of the relationship. When money became the most important aspect of a union, honorable conduct often took a lower priority. But I think their outlook on love and honor was probably a reasonable one. It took into account the true motivations for marriage, which were usually somewhat selfish and influenced by social norms instead of mutual regard. Yet they, in theory, vowed to be faithful to the union anyway, not only keeping up with their roles as a spouse, but earnestly seeking an affectionate relationship with their partner. It seems a much more honest attempt at a successful marriage, even though it was not necessarily more effective than our outlook on marriage today.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-2218934835930369587?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Patricia Seed&amp;#8217;s in-depth account of the transformation of the laws governing marriage in colonial Mexico elucidates the mechanism by which the transformation occurred.  By analyzing several actual cases, Seed is able to create a collage of events that led to this change in the status&amp;nbsp;quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this historical account, Seed outlines the reasons why the Church was so powerful as well as why and how the Church protected the rights of couples instead of the parents&amp;#8217;. Because the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were separate kingdoms brought together through a marriage, the common bond between them was their religion:  Catholicism.  Seed states, &amp;#8220;the crown turned to religion in its search for unity&amp;#8221; (29).  The crown also depended on the Church to reinforce loyalty to the crown; thus the power afforded to the Church allowed them to act independently of royal authority.  The Church, therefore, had the right to exercise municipal power.  The Catholic Church focused on two main reasons for supporting the rights of couples to marry despite parental disapproval:  the first revolves around the idea of the sacred character of marriage, and the second involves the importance of personal will in creating the marriage bond.  Because marriage was sacred, it had to be protected; interference from family members was viewed as an interference with God&amp;#8217;s design.  The Church was also firm to protect the honor of both young men and women wishing to marry.  From a social standpoint, women needed to have their honor protected so that men would follow through with intentions for marriage.  For men, the issue of honor was intertwined with virtue &amp;#8212; marriage was a means of saving a man&amp;#8217;s soul from eternal damnation because intercourse outside of marriage was a moral sin.  Three techniques were utilized by the Church to protect couples:  1) temporary custody &amp;#8212; taking a threatened party into hiding 2) use of the secular arm &amp;#8212; meaning, their ability to call upon the royal police to help the Church in their efforts and 3) secret marriage.  Thus, the Church was afforded great power in establishing the social norm of marrying for love.  However, their power would slowly erode over the next&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slow process of the parental opinion being given credence over that of the children revolves not solely around the changing ideals of marriage but also the transition of authority from Church to State.  The earliest evidence for this social change was shown through documentation of direct opinions from the parents voicing their reasons for preventing their children&amp;#8217;s marriages which was something that had not been documented in earlier years.  This was a sign of the changing times.  The first real step in the transition process was the loss of enforcement of marriage promises and protection of female honor, leading to the overall loss of society&amp;#8217;s interest in providing support for the rights of couples.  Seed also places a lot of the blame for this change in society&amp;#8217;s attitude toward marriage on New Spain&amp;#8217;s involvement with capitalism.  Once the New World entered the world market, money and status became important factors for familial ties.  The New World based on capitalism thus had distinct statuses which were openly based on wealth.  Parents were able to make more logical arguments about status and money as opposed to marrying for something as abstract as&amp;nbsp;love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition of power from Church to State was solidified by the slow waning of power for the Church.  Because of their decrease in power, the Church was unable to protect young couples from interference because they were denied access to the royal police as well as other&amp;nbsp;privileges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this book incredibly intriguing, yet I wonder how accurate some of the points Seed makes can be if she is constantly having to make inferences from factual records.  Regardless of the accuracy of the material, it still makes for an intriguing story of the struggles for&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;In Patricia Seed&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;To Love, Honor, and Obey&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8230;, the author demonstrates how the spread of capitalism throughout Western Europe brought about a dramatic change in popular attitudes towards marriage choice, a change which was reflected over time in the responses  of the Church to conflicts over Marriage.  In the 16th and 17th centuries, whenever there was disagreement between parents and their children with respect to a marriage, the Church always defended the right of children to actualize their own wishes in marriage, rather than obeying the wishes of their parents.  This can be seen in Seed&amp;#8217;s first example, which she dubs &amp;#8220;Romeo and Juliet in Mexico,&amp;#8221; as well as countless other examples Seed uses throughout the book.  The reason for the Church&amp;#8217;s ruling in such disputes is rooted in the cultural perceptions of marriage, seen as an intersection between Will, Love, and Honor.  Seed defines these seemingly amorphous concepts within the Spanish Catholic language of meaning, which saw an individual&amp;#8217;s Will as ordained by God ( as opposed to the Protestant notion of predestination), and Love as a particular manifestation of this Will.  Marriage also involved the concept of Honor, fundamental to the Spanish worldview, which took on two distinct characters: Honor as virtue, which for women meant the preservation of sexual virtue, and for men meant the keeping of promises, such as the promise to marry a girl whose sexual virtue he has sullied, and Honor as status, which means Honor afforded to members of a higher social&amp;nbsp;class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the spread of capitalism in the late 17th and on through the 18th and 19th centuries, Seed traces a paradigmatic shift in view of these three concepts, which over time changed public opinion surrounding parental authority and marriage, thus affecting the Church&amp;#8217;s stance on such issues.  Fist of all, as money gained importance in society Honor as Status began to eclipse Honor as Virtue, and in situations in which these interests collided, such as a man of higher status&amp;#8217;s promise to marry a lower status girl, the side of Status, often reflected in the parents&amp;#8217; wishes for a marriage took precedence.  Also the view of Will as divine ordinance began to diminish as the capacity for fickleness of Will became increasingly apparent, and so the importance attributed to Love was diminished as well.  Essentially, as these concepts became devalued in the public eye, they took a backseat to Interest, a blanket term used to refer to any motive focused on personal gain.  The shift to capitalism was combined with philosophic views which stressed &amp;#8220;rational self-interest&amp;#8221; and utilitarian gain over a religious conception of the world, in which a person&amp;#8217;s will was the manifestation of God&amp;#8217;s will.  While it is common practice in the Western world today to see this shift in values as progress, seeing the Church&amp;#8217;s rule as dogmatic and overbearing, it is important also to realize that in making this shift, the West has swapped a value-system centered around virtue for one centered around money and its &amp;#8220;rational&amp;#8221; acquisition.  In the case of marriage choice, however, as the Church began o change with the culture to incorporate these views into its own doctrine, it in fact became more dogmatic and&amp;nbsp;overbearing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;We have all heard the story of Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story of the star-crossed lovers broke all our hearts at one point or another. Patricia Seed, in her book &lt;em&gt;To Love, Honor, and Obey in Colonial Mexico&lt;/em&gt;, begins by telling the story of Juana and Gerónimo, a similar version of Romeo and Juliet, with two lovers determined to be together despite their parents’ wishes, but this story had a very different ending. The differences, as Seed points out, lie in the understanding of the role of the Church, the role of love or will, and the role of the parents in making decisions in their children lives. It is a common misconception that Spain and therefore, its colonies are structured and governed much like other western European countries like England and France, but that was not the case. These countries favored the system of patriarchy, in which parental consent was required for children to marry. By the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century Mexico too would favor the parents of the children with the gradual loss of power in the Catholic Church and the rise of capitalism, but in the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century when Juana and Gerónimo’s story took place things looked very&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century and the Crown and the Catholic church sort of co-ruled the empire. The Church was responsible for the “social control of the people,” which incorporated ideas about marriage and settling marriage conflicts.  This system allowed the church a good amount of independence when making decisions. For the Mexican Romeo and Juliet, their good fortune came in the fact that the church did not believe in the parents’ right to interfere in a child’s decision to marry especially when based on material reasons. This mainly came from the idea that love was seen as “the action of the will” or as “the expression of the will.” Parents were not allowed to force marriages and thereby control a child’s will. The child’s soul was at stake in making a marriage work since divorce was not an option, so the decision as to who they should marry was to be left mainly to the child. The church believed that a forced marriage would only make the daughter or son unhappy and lead to their disgracing the whole&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honor is another central theme in Seed’s book. Honor was everything in the Spanish culture and that even remains true to some extent today. What has changed is the manner in which one achieves honor. In the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century women had honor by being virtuous, living a sexually pure life. If they violated this in some moment of passion, the church would almost always supersede the desire of the parents and secretly marry a couple in order to spare the women’s disgrace. As time passed and capitalism became the order of the day, materialism began to take on a whole new meaning. By the late 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century one gained honor by being wealthy so now the church did not see the extreme importance of protecting a women’s sexual purity, especially if she wasn’t a&amp;nbsp;noble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the crown and secular rulers gained more authority, the freedom of a child to choose their marriage partner dwindled. The crown eventually did not have the use of the royal police to force a parents’ hand and were more concerned with keeping the local rulers happy so as to keep their jobs than preventing any unwanted marriages.  In 1776 the king issued the Royal Pragmatic which now meant the parental permission was required for a marriage to take place. Where once a husband and a wife had a say in the household now a system of patriarchy took over and where once the crown and church had jointly ruled, the church slowly gave way to a more powerful secular authority, to the detriment of free will in marriage&amp;nbsp;choices.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;For centuries marriage has constantly changed in meaning and practice. We read many difference accounts of marriages that were for monetary of territory gains and not at all about a relationship or love. And the only institution that could arrange a marriage was the church during these times. The Catholic church in Spain at the time kept tight restrictions on marriage and every aspect of it. As centuries passed and marriage changed the church implemented more rules. Divorce and annulment could only be done through the church if a couple was not happy with their marriage but both were hard to obtain. Technically according to the church once you were married the marriage should not be able to break. Only in special cases could you divorce such as proving that the marriage was forced or something of that nature. Once a divorce was granted though the couple could not get remarried for a set amount of time. An annulment was different and it only occurred when it was proven that the marriage should not have happened in the first place. A marriage could be annulled if  one of the party went to the church and claimed that the person they married was their relative or something equally crazy. However there were also those who chose to marry their cousins and even though it was frowned upon by the church couples found ways around it. As the decades went the church began to lose some of its influence on marriage and the royal family began to share the right to make marriages.  While marriage was still about land and combining assets the idea of marriage began to change which led to the shared right to arrange marriages between the two&amp;nbsp;institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;In it, she discusses the changing ideals of colonial Latin America regarding love honor, and obedience, focusing on the desired ideals of the Spanish Catholic Church.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Seed predominantly writes about how the Catholic Church protected the freedom of marriage choice by allowing couples to be married, in spite of the wishes of the community or the couple’s family and protected them from rebuffs of their parents.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These views were sort of revolutionary at the time, with the Spanish Catholic Church and the Church of England being the only groups that held those views of the major Western European religions.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Although they commanded that children obey their parents, they held that God removed children from subjection to their parents when it came to the choice of marriage.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Throughout her book, Seed notes the changes in parental authority throughout the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Later, in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, as the balance of power shifted from the Church and more toward crown authority, marriages were more easily stopped by families opposed to their children’s marriages.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Wealthy families especially held the upper hand, as they were able to use the royal courts to prevent marriages that they viewed as socially undesirable, which was, during the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, an invalid reason.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These changes were, in part, due to the shift in attitudes towards the importance of money and economic success.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That is why, in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century threats of inheritance was viewed as a legitimate excuse to stop a marriage between two people.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Seed also discusses the meaning of love to these colonial Latin Americans.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Their view of love meant nothing of what it does today.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In the reasons why couples desired to wed, love, or at least our meaning of it, was not viewed upon as good.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If a couple reasoned that they were in love and wanted to be married, they were looked at as foolish and immature individuals and believed that they were blinded by passion and could not think rationally.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Instead of “amor” they would use “te gusta” to convey that they liked each other and that they were two compatible people who wished to marry.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These views were very different to what I am used to in today’s culture, where just the opposite would be true.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If a couple just said they “liked” each other and were “compatible” one would question their love for one another and a potential marriage.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;While, if a couple outwardly showed and confessed love to one another, however sickening it may look, we would believe that the couple genuinely loved each other.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;This book really opened my eyes to the practices and beliefs of the colonial culture and their views on love.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;To my surprise, they were not as different in their beliefs on marriage and free will as our culture&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Throughout history (not exclusive to Spanish or Spanish-American history), honor or the promotion and protection thereof has served as a justification for discriminatory policies and attitudes, particularly concerning sexual and marital relations. However, as discussed in Patricia Seed’s To Love, Honor, and Obey in Colonial Mexico, this conception of honor has evolved over time, reflecting changing values and power structures and challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mutual conception of honor – moral and social – degraded in stages. The moral conception of honor tied to sexual behavior quickly due to the frequent violation of the traditional model (specifically that, a model à not reflecting the common achieved). These frequent violations of the model, though still discouraged, could not be tied to severe punishment, especially when considering other conception of honor – the social conception. The social conception of honor was related to an attribute reserved to the upper class to wealth more generally, and even this later some encouraged to be broadened, though still of course to the exclusion of others. The distinctions of social class were family and economic situation, which proved to be a source of tension within the upper class, but both groups hoped to exclude the lower classes and “keep clean” the race from the “darker” classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this is the role of gender and race in determining the degree of permissibility of interracial relations. White men could have sexual relations with “dark” women with little chastisement, if any, but marriage to one was for some time deemed unacceptable. This attitude reflects society’s view of dark women as subservient, sexual objects rather than those intended for marital consumption. At the same time, as the Church later sought to legitimize these relationships further, the Church encouraged marriages between white men and dark women with whom they had previously had sexual relations; however, when white women intended to marry dark men, they met with intense and severe opposition by the Church and society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say I were surprised or indignant at this display of patriarchy to “protect and control the woman’s sexuality” – but I am honestly amused by the depth of the double standard.&lt;br /&gt;To the Africans in the Mexican community, on the other hand, honor seems to be much simpler and much less subject to the whims of the ruling class. Honor reflects an ability to sustain one’s family – such as through economic power – not through family connections or skin color.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-1446764811844859313?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Looking back on Patricia Seed&amp;#8217;s book I feel almost mad at the way parents felt that they should control the marriage of their children. Then I think about how I would feel if one of my children were to marry someone that I did not approve of. It is because of this, that I had mixed emotions throughout the entire book.  Can you imagine if it were this way today? Granted, some parents are not always happy about the marriage choice of their children but once the child is 18 years old he or she has the choice of marriage and the choice is that person&amp;#8217;s alone.  I am recently engaged and luckily my parent like my fiancé but while I was reading I was thinking of how I would feel if they didn&amp;#8217;t want me to marry her.  I like to think that I would stand up to my parents and tell them that I will do what I want instead of trying to runaway and hide it like most of the couples mentioned in the&amp;nbsp;book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I put my place in the shoes of the parents.  Okay, I will be the first to admit that if I had a daughter and she married a complete tool I would be pissed and try my best to let her know that I don&amp;#8217;t approve.  Let&amp;#8217;s get real though, I would never threaten to kill over it or lock her up like an animal.  Of course time and trends were different then than they are now but I think they acted too extreme.  Obviously changes in customs and social norms make it hard for us to understand why parents acted the way they&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the reading I felt like each story was so similar that I was reading the same thing over and over.  Although it seems redundant it is amazing that she personally researched and documented each case to effectively prove her points.  I really feel like I gained a better understanding of the marriage processes and parental influence of this era simply from reading Seed&amp;#8217;s well written&amp;nbsp;book.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This week we looked at the Patricia Seed book, &amp;#8220;To Love, Honor, and Obey in Colonial Mexico&amp;#8221;, which was a pretty in depth and detailed analysis of a period of about three centuries. It was nice to have the opportunity to read a longer, full length argument in which the author took several hundred pages to develop and support her argument. She uses an unbelievable amount of sources, covering almost 50 pages with just citations. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good analysis of the social morphology surrounding marriage dynamics from the 16th to 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic argument centered around the idea that changes in the social structure/common thought resulted in new and different views towards marriage. The book was organized in such a way as to present ideas about love, will, honor, and the church in the 16th century and then to explain how and why those ideas changed through time. Furthermore, it related the changing perceptions and roles of those things to changing attitudes towards marriage. One thing my group talked extensively about last Thursday was the earlier perceptions of love. It was interesting that early Spanish society &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;condemned marriage for economic, political, or social gain&amp;#8221; (53). It seems that throughout the majority of history in most cultures the purpose of marriage was for reasons other than modern ideas of love, yet by this time in Spanish society the idea of love was dominant in relationships, and even protected by the church. This seems farfetched initially, but when considered alongside this society&amp;#8217;s preoccupation with &amp;#8220;will&amp;#8221; and the protection of it in religious sacraments, it makes sense. Seed explains that, &amp;#8220;This organizational need to stress free will produced a renewed Catholic emphasis on the necessity of the parties&amp;#8217; freely given consent to a marriage&amp;#8221; (33). It is interesting that the Church would intervene on the part of the children in protection from the parents, an idea that seems very&amp;nbsp;modern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found even more shocking, however, was that this freedom evaporated as time went on, and as the Church weakened. I feel like movements towards less Church control are often related with more freedom, but this book demonstrated that as the Church lost control of the royal police, and became seemingly more irrelevant, young adults actually lost rights to marry, and were more subservient to the wishes of their parents. It was interesting to read the extent to which some parents would go to prevent marriages, even exiling their kids. As the Church became less involved in the private affairs of peoples lives, rights of the younger generation were actually lost, and parents had more control over their kids. This seems anti-progressive in modern concepts of rights, but it seems to simply be the result of changing dynamics regarding the role of religion in people&amp;#8217;s personal decisions. I enjoyed Seed&amp;#8217;s perspective on how these changing dynamics affected marriages, and it provides good insight into not only the social and gender relations in Spain, but also in Early Latin America, in which Spain had a very strong&amp;nbsp;presence.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I have learned many new and interesting things about women from Spain in c. 17 century.  Mostly on the topic of how women had a strong control of their dowry.  It seem interesting to me that when a man married a women that they would even get any dowry in the first place.  I had the impression that the man had to provide everything he earned to his family.  It is nice to learn that this dowry was to help the couple in creating a new life together.  It was also nice to see that the men had go get permission from there wife to spend any part of the dowry, on the other had the wife had go get permission as well for the same privilege.  I believe that overall the female had the most control over the dowry because if she got a divorce she got to take her dowry with her and she could also divorce her husband if she finds him stilling from the dowry.  To me this is a sign that women in Spain are starting to gain some control and power.  Also this week I enjoyed reading To Love, Honor, and Obey.  It seems to be a romantic idea of the Catholic Church to let people marry for love.  In the colonial time period many parents would try to get their children to marry others who were in the same social economic class not for who they fell in love with.  I do have an understanding for parents wanting their children to marry a person who could provide a good living for them in the future, but to get married to someone without loving them seems to be horrible and unjust.  I like how the Catholic Church did not get faded into letting their parents picking their partner and let people marry for love.  Reading Seeds book I have seen many similarity in my Mexican American, Catholic family, for I don’t see much change forms Seeds research in the 16th -19th century to today.  Right now my older sister is thinking about to get married to a man in the Army, which my parents are not too fond of.  It&amp;#8217;s not that they do not like men in the Army, but they do not like the high risk of having a husband who can get deployed at any moment&amp;#8217;s notice, and also having a high risk of him passing away.  They don’t think she is strong enough to handle it or the fact that she might not see him for months at a time.  So in that aspect it&amp;#8217;s a bit different, but overall the same as parents wanting to control who their children get married to.  Maybe I should get my parents to read the book so they can have a better&amp;nbsp;insight.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Colonial Mexico differed greatly than their counterparts in France and England because marriage in the former was on marriage while the latter based on economic interest. Marriage was either promoted or discouraged based on the families’ ability to improve their social standing. However, in Mexico they felt the need to base their decisions on emotions rather than reason. The Catholic Church tried to promote marriages based on love in the colony by saying that love happened by reason, according to St. Thomas Aquinas.  The local Mexicans saw the interference of the families for financial stability and prosperity as malicious and wrong. This different with continental Europe that saw the need for people to try and gain new social status. It was more of a contract between families rather than two Romeo and Juliet figures. The story at the beginning of the book best demonstrates this. Geronimo and Juana were in “love” and tried to go against their families. Geronimo’s father locked him up because the two families were actually rivals; therefore, an economic incentive was used to discourage marriage. Yet, the Church, trying to do the “right” thing, intervened on behalf of the misguided youths and allowed them to marry against the parent’s&amp;nbsp;wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to our culture today. Rather than putting stock in the past, in arranged marriages, or in match making, Americans and liberalized states across the world feel the need to promote love among their children as a basis for marriage. This, I would submit, hurts society as a whole, rather than helping it. Sure, it makes people (feminists?) feel good about promoting “equality” by saying women have a choice in the marriage, but this demonstrates their lack of understanding concerning match making and arranged marriages. They are similar to dating websites, but instead of a random person choosing who will make the best match, it is the parents. I contend based on the book To Love, Honor, and Obey that the European continent had a better idea concerning marriage then the Mexican colony in the Americas. Patricia Seed describes a distinct phenomenon that occurred during the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. This tradition did not last well into the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, but it does set them apart from the&amp;nbsp;Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to say what this really means in a historical context. Were love matches better for society? Or arranged marriages for financial means more successful? A culture and society are too complicated to say whether these affected the success of the state and the people. But, for the individual families, it was clearly better for them when there was an economic motivation. Basing the relationship on love put the individual above the family and rejected the community for one’s personal&amp;nbsp;ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history465/blog/seed-transforming-marriages.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;First off, I was blown away by the depth that Seed went into to portray this transformation of marriage in Spanish society. She studied over 16,000 cases if you didn&amp;#8217;t remember this from our class discussion, and this makes her argument quite compelling! I think you have to be pretty passionate about something to put such effort into things, but regardless, this book contextualizes terms in a historical manner and uses anecdotes that really emphasize the topic of marriage through the almost 300 years Seed&amp;nbsp;covers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the book is split into chronological arrangement, beginning with early 16th century Spain and bringing readers through up to the 19th century. Context-wise it was very interesting to read about how marriage was considered a sacrament in early Spain and evolved into &amp;#8220;love&amp;#8221; over the years. What is really interesting was when marriage was considered a sacrament, the Catholic Church  seemed to have much more authority and control over marriages and what it consisted of between men and women. So, if a child was not permitted marriage by his or her parents, he or she could protest to the church, permitting more autonomy to choice of marriage. However, as marriage shifted towards love, this was also when property and land-ownership was increasingly becoming important, thus, the Catholic Church was still present, but parents seemed to have much more authority and control due to the role that property played into marriages. Seed really talks about the authority of fathers and how social status through land ownership allowed the family to have more sayso in a child&amp;#8217;s marriage because this directly affected the inheritances of&amp;nbsp;families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love was not the only evolving aspect, as Seed discusses, but as her title suggests, &amp;#8220;honor&amp;#8221; changed too. Early on, and we even discussed this in class on numerous occasions, female chastity and male virility were to be honored and protected in early Spain, albeit on a prescriptive level as we all know that actual practices of people were not as &amp;#8220;ideal&amp;#8221; as the church would like. (I don&amp;#8217;t think times have changed much in our &amp;#8220;ideals&amp;#8221; v. practices, do you?) But back to the main point, honor shifted more towards social status and again, property ownership. Can we all see an overwhelming theme? Capitalism and land ownership really changed society, as we originally saw when the Spanish took over Indigenous and African&amp;nbsp;lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seed&amp;#8217;s book  portrays exceptionally well how honor shifted towards social status and patriarchy became much stronger, and marriages during this time reflected this transformation. In our small groups on Thursday, my group happened to talk about what life must have been for children during this time, and I can&amp;#8217;t say that I&amp;#8217;m too upset I wasn&amp;#8217;t around to experience not being able to choose a marriage partner based on inheritance and property ownership. Of course, then, for women especially, I guess marriage or entering the Church was your only route to having a life/social status, so maybe being married off to enhance your family&amp;#8217;s status wasn&amp;#8217;t all that bad. I&amp;#8217;m a little biased, as we can tell&amp;#8230;.Seed&amp;#8217;s book, nonetheless, was eye-opening, and 16,000 cases for reference sure makes&amp;nbsp;it convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The book we read for this week, &lt;em&gt;To Love, Honor, and Obey in Colonial Mexico&lt;/em&gt; by Patricia Seed, pretty much blew away the majority of my preconceived notions about marriage in colonial Mexican society (to the extent that I had any!).  Seed argues that until the late 17th century, marrying for love was the norm, and a norm protected vigorously by the Catholic Church.  Seed&amp;#8217;s book basically revealed to me that I had previously thought that people started marrying for love around about&amp;nbsp;1960.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her argument centers around the changing conception of marriage following the Reformation in Europe in the 16th century.  Marriage became, countering Luther&amp;#8217;s doctrine that marriage was a civil affair, a holy sacrament.  This meant that it had to be entered into freely, or it was worthless.  The Church, then, had to defend marrying for love from parents/guardians who wanted marriage for gain.  And it remained that way for several hundred years.  What happened was that the world changed around the Church, and its ideas about marriage became antiquated and out of step.  Marriage became again about social gain (at least for those who had anything to gain or lose).  What Seed says happens is the birth of capitalism.  As wealth for some increased, maintaining it became ever important.  Cultural values around what gave people status changed (wealth and class status replaced virtue as the source of social standing).  Marriage for love, without thought to the social consequences, became anathema.  Parents went out of their way to make sure their children married the partner whose status/wealth matched/exceeded their own; and the Church became less able and less willing to do anything about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of Seed&amp;#8217;s evidence comes from reading the cases of marriage disputes (where someone wishes to prevent another person from marrying) for the entirety of the colonial period in Mexico.  What she learns is that the arguments that successfully prevent marriage changed.  They started out being only things like too close relations, previous promises to marry, etc.  Arguments like &amp;#8220;they&amp;#8217;re too poor&amp;#8221; didn&amp;#8217;t cut it.  Eventually, however, challenges based on unequal social status (wealth, race) started to work.  The actions taken by the Church to ensure marriages were free, and not coerced, changed as well.  The Church, for a period of time, would perform secret marriages and offer protective custody.  These practices became rarer and rarer even though the Church&amp;#8217;s rhetoric stayed the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seed&amp;#8217;s approach included not only the aforementioned analysis of archival records, but also close readings of popular literature in Spain and religious texts about marriage put out by the Church.  This approach enabled her to not only analize actual practice, but also to give the reader a sense of where the culture was at and what the rhetoric of the Church was.  The discrepancies are quite&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;this week read the book To Love Honor and Obey in Colonial Mexico. the book was a slow read but we luckily had spring break to work on it. the work is interesting however, it argues that changes in the social views in marital patterns in Latin America. the issues of parental control over the children and their choice in marital partners, the idea of individuals marrying not for duty to family or country but for love,  as well as the importance of people not being &amp;#8220;sold&amp;#8221; to marriage as property. the book was broken up into a structural chronology. going from event to event, which really aided in understanding the progression of events and ideas in Latin America. the story of Geronimo and Juana really caught me. i have always enjoyed the Romeo and Juliet tales as well as Tristan and Isolde. the great difference is that the opposing forces in the Geronimo and Juana tale is that Geronimo and Juana did not come from feuding rival families but rather it was merely each of their fathers hated the other&amp;#8217;s father. as well as Juana being imprisoned in order to separate her from Geronimo. the church,  a more powerful force in the Geronimo and Juana tale than it was in the Romeo and Juliet tale, goes to bat for the star crossed lovers and wins. the couple are not forced to commit some great show of love in death because thanks to the pressure of the church and the social pressures and changing social attitudes about love the couple live &amp;#8216;happily ever after&amp;#8217; in comparison to the romeo tale in which both lovers commit suicide. it is interesting that in Latin America in the sixteenth century the church could undermine the father&amp;#8217;s parental authority where as going into the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Patria Potestad, or Father&amp;#8217;s will, would rule above the church. the council of Trent had a large impact on the ideas of marriage, it redefined the idea of sex and sexuality in the Catholic faith. it also redefined marriage against a parent&amp;#8217;s will. this was in addition to rising popular opinion that their should be choice and free will involved in the marriage process. the situation in Latin America is vastly different, as seen in Geronimo and Juana from the situations and practises of Europe and those shown in the story of Romeo and Juliet.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7292399274560322422-2496904774321081087?l=asfhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Chapter Seven of &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Indian Women in Early Mexico&lt;/span&gt; discusses the use of last wills and testaments in Mexica society. They were used by men and women alike to outline the inheritance of important family heirlooms and valuable possessions. The statistics given regarding these documents clearly show the unique situation of many Nahua people at the time, as they learned about Spanish culture and watched the effects of it on their own people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting aspect of these wills is their extensive use by women. In Spanish traditions (though not always in practice), women were not allowed to own property, but the Mexica valued the responsibilities of women, and the control of certain parts of land and possessions went along with their duties. Women usually left their wealth or holdings to their children, often to their daughters, in order to ensure that they would retain the rights promised them by the traditions of their people. The household goods that were often left to girls also helped teach them to value the traditional duties of a woman, and to expect the honor that their participation in society was supposed to give them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The practice of writing wills was a Spanish one, and did not begin in Latin America until it was colonized. It would be easy to think, then, that the documents were drafted in order to please the conquistadors and conform to their society. But they were written in Nahuatl, which means they were meant for fellow natives to read and understand. It reminds me of the traditional Nahuatl dialogues, which were transcribed by a Dominican monk, but were intended for the education of the natives by their own leaders, and contained many praises of the old system, as well as references to the parallel gender system by which the Mexica society was structured. The wills, similarly, were a native adoption of a Spanish practice that they then used to serve their own motives, namely the preservation of traditions and society. The Spanish, after all, were vastly outnumbered by the natives in Latin America, so it was nearly impossible for them to spread their own culture as quickly as many people believe they did. They did not present a system that was infinitely better than the Mexica way of life, nor did they all spend much time trying to understand the native society. Consequently, the natives were able to retain much of their belief system, including their ideas about gender roles, by conforming the new Spanish practices to their traditional values.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The importance of these documents, then, comes both from their revelations about the preservation of gender and their revelations about the preservation of Nahua ideals in general. These natives were not ignorant or passive people. Though they are often portrayed as savages who practiced human sacrifice and were wiped out by the more educated Spanish, there were much broader motivations to their belief systems, based on their religion and their ideas about the order of the universe. Many of their attempts to pass these values through the generations were successful, which is why so much of the native culture remains prevalent in Latin America even in modern times.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-7405087690200918926?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;One question that has been nagging at me these last couple of weeks is with regards to families, both Spanish and Indigenous, “gifting” their daughters hand in marriage. My first thoughts were that the daughters had been treated as though they were property with either their dowry or familial social/political status as the trade off. Even prior to the Spanish conquering, this same social gifting was prevalent. However, after reading Pedro Carrasco’s essay on Indian and Spanish intermarriage, I began to wonder something else, something that I have yet to see discussed in any of our readings. My question is simple, what if in our modern day know-it-all ethnocentric attitudes, we have misunderstood the acting of “gifting” itself?  &lt;br /&gt;    Our focus has been on explaining and trying to understand gender roles and assignments from the late 15th century to currently the late 16th century. Yesterday while dealing with my divorce, I reflected on why I married my husband and how funny the concept would have been if my dad had “gifted” me to my husband and his family; though I am pretty sure since they have always treated me like crap, they would have rather he kept his loud mouth liberal daughter… At any rate the thought popped into my head that my father had “gifted” me so to speak. In most traditional marriages, the bride is usually “given” to the groom by the bride’s family.  Then I asked myself, what if our understanding of the word “gift” in relation to marriages we are studying has been either misinterpreted or misunderstood. &lt;br /&gt;Some might argue that no, they were literal gifts especially since the Indigenous have their own version prior to the conquest.  Carrasco was only able to study intermarriages of the upper echelon of both ethnic realms, mainly because they would have been the only written down or recorded somewhere. However, the idea of a bride’s family giving the equivalent of some form of capital in their society, perhaps land or an actual dowry is nothing new and would have crossed both social and economic barriers; after all, do not most parents want to help their newly married children out with money, furniture or help them find achieve a home of their own? A friend of mine got married over the weekend to another friend of mine from high school. Who gave her away? You guessed it, her family. What did this mean? It meant that those two families are now linked through the marriage of their children. Is this any different from families in the past? No. My in-laws did not like me (and quite frankly there is no love lost on my side either), however, our families will forever be linked. Why? My husband and I had three children, all sons. Regardless of whether my husband and I are married or not, and regardless of my husband and his family disowning my children socially, they are still an undeniable link to his family. My children’s history and heritage comes from both sides because unlike the Holy mother of Christ, I was impregnated by a dork from West Tennessee, not the Holy Spirit, therefore my children and part of their lineage come from their biological father and well as myself. Unfortunately, unlike most of the fathers from Ourense, Spain (Allyson Poska’s essays), my husband apparently thinks he should be able to leave his wife and children, with no child support or alimony, and deny his children their legitimacy and bloodline through his family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do not ask how I got off on this tangent, I gave up “coca-cola” for lent and my mind needs caffeine in order to function properly. Though considering lent is a Catholic practice, I might be able to later tie it into a future discussion…&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-8574731842668724271?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Rebecca Horn&amp;#8217;s article on the naming practice of Nahuan children brought out many interesting facts, such as the &amp;#8220;acceptance&amp;#8221; of the catholic faith, social class, gender differences.  As a study of mostly baptismal records, Horn was able to indicate key factors that went in to the naming of nahuan children post-conquest.  Once again Spanish, mostly Christian culture dominated the realms of names, especially as time went on.  One must remember that the names present in this study are only of those Nahuans that subjected themselves to the Catholic faith through baptism.  Horn points out that for early baptisms, it would have been the baptizing priest or friars who would have named the child. I believe this to be very important due to many aspects.  First off, priest and friars are men, so when it came to  giving christian saint names, one would assume that the fathers would choose feminized male saints names over those of female saints.  This could be due to the devotions the friars had, or as Horn stated the lack of knowledge on the&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naming of Nahuas was also affected by their social class and gender.  Horn states that female pre-conquest names tended to be more stereotypical while male names were more personal.  Horn points out that this, most-likly had something to do with act of marriage and the female joining the husbands kinship.  This lack of personalization of names followed into the post-cpnquest time period.  Horn also disscussed how ones class would determine their name or rather specail and sometimes Spanish surnames were gifted to the elite&amp;nbsp;nahua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horn&amp;#8217;s article shows how the spanish institutionalized something that would be considered something that would be personal:  one&amp;#8217;s name.  Once again the Church had a hand in this cultural&amp;nbsp;domination.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;So it seems that there exists a certain theme between some of the readings from last week and this week.  Allyson Poska in her article &amp;#8220;Elusive Virtue&amp;#8221; masterfully depicted that female chastity and virtue were not as prevalent of ideals in early modern Spain as they were in other parts of Europe.  Similarly, Kimberly Gauderman explains that the centralized authority in the realm of the household and government were not principles held by pre-colonial Spaniards, though their neighboring countries followed these&amp;nbsp;norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, Spain and Spanish territories followed what we deem more &amp;#8220;progressive&amp;#8221; norms prior to the colonial period.  There existed less of a discrepancy between the autonomy of men and women in society during the earlier years; however, they also followed a method of governing that was extremely curious for that period.  During the Reconquest, the Spanish crown expanded into many different territories each with their own set of traditions and lifestyles, and with these conquests, the new Spanish territories were allowed to self-govern with the decree &amp;#8220;I obey but do not execute.&amp;#8221; Gauderman points out that many of the crown&amp;#8217;s wishes were unfulfilled, such as the crown&amp;#8217;s orders for the Peruvian government to pay higher taxes.  The Peruvian viceroy utilized the &amp;#8220;I obey but do not execute&amp;#8221; decree in this situation because the crown did not lose money to attain the territory nor had they provided any extra benefit to the Peruvians that would require extra taxation.  This reflected just one facet of the decentralization of the Spanish government, but the point that Gauderman is trying to convey is that the authority of the household reflects that of the government in that in areas where a centralized authority with a male figurehead was valued, so were the ideals of female subordination.  Conversely, the authority of the Spanish government was ambiguous and as such, so was the authority of the private household.  Because men and women were both allowed to inherit equally and retain ownership of property after marriage and both parties made decisions about the family economy, one could not safely conclude that one party held absolute power in the household.  Women also were allowed to pass on their inheritance to their children regardless of whether or not their husbands approved of the issuance.  Women were also provided with several other rights that would suggest that the idea of women as &amp;#8220;lesser beings&amp;#8221; did not prevail during this time in Spain.  Also, when considering the argument that Poska made in her article that the loss of female chastity often went without much consequence, it would seem that women were allowed sovereignty and&amp;nbsp;equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am curious as to how these ideals suddenly switched to more conservative and chauvinistic values during the later Colonial time period.  I can&amp;#8217;t imagine that the implementation of these ideals would have brought much benefit to the society, but if Gauderman&amp;#8217;s theory is correct and the household reflects the government, then the progression to a centralized government would provoke the need for a central authority within the private realm, and it seems that men won that&amp;nbsp;privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The writings on Nahuatl Last Will and Testaments are very interesting in that they are a very foreign to the Nahuatl people but were brought by the Spaniards into the New World all the same, however the Nahuatl take on this new idea and bend it to their will and use it in order to continue their ways of life. like the town councils, which were merely a renaming of the city elders and chiefs, the people wrote, or had written for them by notaries, Last Wills and Testaments, but they are molding these specifically Spanish imports. The Nahuatl used the Spanish form of passing things onto those left behind after one died in order to perpetuate their own beliefs, such as the dichotomy of what belonged to women and the importance of social roles in Nahuatl society. For example they Nahuatl women perpetuated the women&amp;#8217;s role in society even in the items they left their daughters after they passed on, such as combs or cookware, which perpetuated the &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_0&#34;&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;-conquest ideals of women at the home and hearth and men as protectors and warriors. it also further proves that women were not as helpless and non-entities as much of history or a Man&amp;#8217;s world would have individuals believe. the Nahuatl women not only held property but also passed it onto their heirs as a women or man of today&amp;#8217;s culture might do. they passed on what they believed their heirs would need most to help them live happily and &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-corrected&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_1&#34;&gt;successfully&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7292399274560322422-7978395742926075066?l=asfhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I am going to focus on the chapter in &lt;em&gt;Indian Women in Early Mexico &lt;/em&gt;concerning the naming of Nahua women postconquest. It seems thematic that naming has been quite indicative of the Spanish conquest, not only during the Indigenous conquest we first learned about, but in the African slave trade that we discussed a week ago. As soon as the slaves arrived to the Americas, thier names were changed. And how were they changed? To something &amp;#8220;Christian&amp;#8221; related. So, of course, the Nahua men and women postconquest really express this change due to Spanish invasion, as they too take on Christain names. Interestingly so, as the article really points out, Nahua naming patterns were based more on order of childbirth, with no sense of surname, although male names were more unique than female names. Identity wasn&amp;#8217;t at this point as much in a name as it was on kinship, another major theme we really discussed in class concerning Indigenous culture. After the Spanish arrived, however, Christian names were the dominant form found in Nahua men and women, except this time, patron saints were the names of choice, and surnames were also more popular. What does this point to? The fact that private property, a Spanish/European way of life, had infiltrated native culture, and in many ways taken over it, the idea of who was to own land or inherit it became a concern, thus, leading to the importance of&amp;nbsp;naming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s interesting how again there is such a difference between the Indiginous culture and focus on kinship versus European/Spanish/American. It seems that alot of effort went into upholding the church and its ideals, even down to using saints&amp;#8217; names for identity, but the very cultures that it dominated seemed to actually act out a much more Christian, kinship community. Also, this shift to naming as a clear identity for people really reflects the importance of the family over the community. With more focus on inheritance patterns due to land ownership, it was important to be identified throughout one&amp;#8217;s family, and not necessarily through the outside&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish clearly had a looming power dynamic, with its ability to uproot these cultures and change their ways of life even down to naming patterns. Also, it feels as if all of this always goes back to the Catholic church and Spain&amp;#8217;s significant tie to the upholding of its values. I could even argue that the church is the sole reason that these conquests occurred; hence, when discussing power and politics, even gender roles, you cannot overlook how important the church&amp;#8217;s role is! Again, though, these seemingly simple changes, like in naming patterns indicate so much more than we really think. Identities and roles were changing,&amp;nbsp;too&amp;#8230;..&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:100%;&#34; &gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;In class on Thursday, my group discussed the introduction and first chapter of Kimberly Gauderman’s book, Women’s Lives in Colonial Quito.  Right away she mentions that racial status was more important than gender or marital status in the lives of these people.  She claims that people defined themselves on the basis of Indians and non-Indians more so than on gender.  I found this to be a bold, sweeping statement, and I am not quite sure whether or not I believe her.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Reading Gauderman’s perspective, it seems as if women had fewer rights in the colonial period over time, specifically involving controlling their own property and other financial decisions.  These women were looked at as minors, and consequently, being controlled sexually, financially, and in their labor powers.  One speculation as to why women’s rights seemed to decrease from the 17th to the 18th century may involve the example Queen Isabella set during the rule of her and her husband, Ferdinand, in which she was the dominant ruler of the two in that she acquired more lands and governing powers.  Gauderman explains this reasoning when she wrote, “ the growing power of the father in the family during the latter part of the colonial period, in fact, coincides with changes in the structure of crown authority.” (p. 27)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Further emphasizing her point that women obtained lesser power during the 18th century in Latin America, she describes one of the roles of women as tokens exchanged among men to create a sort of bond or agreement.  Some societies gave women, specifically their own daughters, to signal alliances and hope of future favors or gifts.  She even boldly declares that women underwent a “civil death” when they were given to men as tokens.  I think this is a little extreme and sort of an exaggeration because in previous centuries, fathers that gave their daughters to a husband usually expected some sort of dowry.  This was nothing new.  Another sweeping claim Gauderman makes is that, once women married, they disappeared from society and the husbands became their wife’s voice in legal processes and all public life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Gauderman goes on to discuss the political sphere and the power of the king.  From what I read, it seems as if the king had no power over many issues, especially taxes.  It is somewhat amusing to read that if the people did not want to pay the taxes the king issued, they would raise a revolt and refuse to pay.  This shows how much power the people had in relation to the king.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Back to Gauderman’s introductory statement that racial status was more important than gender or marital status in the lives of these Latin America peoples.  The evidence she provides does not necessarily back up this statement.  Placing the title of women undergoing a “civil death” upon marriage seems like it would weigh pretty heavy regarding the importance of marital status over racial status.  Likewise, her claims of the derogatory ways women’s importance was lessened, it seemed as if she placed the importance of gender over racial status in the lives of women.  From my initial reaction of the opinions of Gauderman, and only reading a part of her writings, I would believe that she definitely places gender over racial status, as well as marital status as the most important factor affecting the lives of colonial Latin Americans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4551310302796999455-3805809234765244600?l=laurenhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Patriarchy is usually used by shrill feminists who usually blame everything on some “old, white guy.” However, this explanation is thoroughly challenged by a real academician who does not simply resign power over to men, like the feminist explanation actually does. When one says that patriarchy explains the inequalities in society between men and women they make the woman a powerless party in the entire scheme. However, nothing could be further from the truth. This is demonstrated in many different ways. Women acted with economic interests in several different ways.  One example used in class was the Puritans. The Puritans were actually ok with pre-marital fornication as long as the male stayed in the area and intended to marry the pregnant bride. It became a problem when the men began moving West, and the family had to take care of the illegitimate child. It was not as one student tried to childishly explain that a old, white man forced his morality on the woman. It was much more complicated than that. The family as a whole had to deal with the burden of an unwed mother, which meant that the woman made decisions concerning her family’s life. She was not a passive actor in the entire process. Instead, she held power by shaping the policy of the&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter one of “Women’s Lives in Colonial Quito” by Kimberly Gauderman, the  use patriarchy as the simplest explanation is debunked by an academic, not utilized like a blunt tool as most feminists try to do.  Yet, she acknowledges its existence by discussing the role of the king and father in relation to the family. Patriarchy obviously exists, but the complexities of the situation call for stronger analyses than just blaming white men. In fact, Gauderman wrote: “The conflicts between parallel intities with shared and competing interests produced the tension which held the network together; in other words, social stability was the product of continual contestations of power rippling through a web rather than obedience generated through vertical lines of authority” (pg 29). This quote explains how complex the system was and how the women took the role to change things. She fought (not literally, metaphorically) for her rights and existence within the family unit. She struggled to gain more power and equality with the men in her life. Does this mean equality was actually achieved? No, of course not. But women did not just sit down and take, nor were they powerless as simply yelling patriarchy does. When people see that men did create tyranny over women, but women challenged that tyranny regularly, then they can understand the dynamics of patriarchy in&amp;nbsp;societies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt; Having completed our assigner readings for the previous week I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of interest I took in the subjects covered.  Namely the various topics in the first chapter of Women’s Lives in Colonial Quito.  It was new and refreshing to study cases proving that a complete societal system of founded on patriarchy was not, and is not, universal throughout the globe.  For the majority of my life I had studied under the assumption that this was, in fact, not the case.  But I attribute this mainly to the information that I had been exposed to in detail.  Hailing mostly from western European nations such as France and England, both of which share similar histories of feminist struggles that developed roughly along the same basic timelines, America has a history of patriarchal patterns in many facets of society.  Obviously the first to come to mind is the distribution of domestic authority.  I hold no doubt that the majority of Americans do, or at the very least historically have, in fact assume that the male/father/husband role that is filled in the nuclear family is also the source of most decision making and is therefore the authoritative figurehead.&lt;br /&gt;
    Delving into the assigned readings with this mindset, it is easy to understand how the roles of men and women were in comparison surprising, different, and at least on some levels, more equal than those of many other western European cultures.  For instance, upon the death of an elder estate owner land would be divided amongst numerous relatives, including women.  This would rarely be the case in many other nations where it would seem mechanical for the eldest male to receive the estate in its entirety.  Upon studying them, Spanish societies have struck me as far more progressive in many gender related aspects vis-à-vis other European nations and colonies.&lt;br /&gt;
    I also took careful note of the text’s early mentioning of the representation of feminism and feminist women.  A typical western feminist woman is usually considered a master of her own domain.  By this I mean that she is in full control of her own sexuality and makes decisions that affect her on her own, being completely free to do so.  Also, she is the result of generations of women gradually overcoming obstacles that have held back her gender.  This portrayal ‘ideal modern woman’ seemingly holds potential for a detrimental impact on how we view women of third world nations, as well as their history.  Western feminism tends to group women of developing nations into a category of repressed and disempowered individuals who share identical beginnings and struggles with western women.  But is this necessarily the case?  History as a whole in Spanish societies shows that its women have, basically, always been subject to differing treatment from that of typical western&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div&gt;I considered the readings for this week largely a reiteration - compelling or not -  of themes and thoughts all ready dispersed throughout the classes’ lectures and readings. As the selected authors seem to largely rely on the same bits of evidence to support the thesis that women were important contributors to Spanish-American society, with sometimes separate but nonetheless significant spheres in life, I question whether this redundancy augments the argument made or discounts it. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;So we all should well understand by now that women, throughout indigenous, African, and Spanish societies, had distinct social and economic rights, as well as sometimes political rights granted in differing degrees. These lines for comparison are compelling in terms of analyzing women’s pre-colonial status as parallel, though perhaps not equal, to men’s. It certainly seems that the qualities associated with women’s status in the colonial era - subservience, obedience, chastity, etc. - are inventions of European culture, oft tied to the influence of and the virtues associated with the Church. Further, individual societies’ differing degrees of compliance with the proclaimed and expected virtues for each gender role demonstrates both the independently determined values of the society as well as the decentralization of authority, characteristic both of Spanish governance and society and that of Spanish America. This model most readily transferred to the New World on account of the shift of Spanish recognition of monarchical authority to the new colonial lands as well as similar governance patterns established, through the establishment of primary colonial centers, known as viceroyalties, and satellite centers of economic production, cultural practice, and local government. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, some of the analyses contending that women’s situation in the colonial (and pre-colonial) society was not one in the periphery or on a subservient level to that of men lead me to question the assertion, simply in that most of said analyses rely largely on extrapolation from sources produced by the elite or by the government (run by elites) rather than direct inference from primary sources of women in a variety of social classes. For example, the most interesting (and perhaps enlightening) sources have been those from legal documents, often cited when arguing women’s economic participation and rights, and sermons highlighting the respectable respective situations of men and women, such as the purpose of and roles within marriage. However, both of these are provided not from the men or women themselves, discussing their respective statuses and lot in life, but rather from supra-individual forms, which both reflect cultural attitudes but also provide a guide for such. We have rarely, if ever, been granted direct testimony from women that can support or deny the primary assertion. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The dearth of such leads me to beg the question, “Why?” Is it perhaps because women were largely not granted much education through which to express their ideas formally (or informally) in a record that could be referenced historically? Is it because women did not have the social or political freedom to express their opinions greatly, especially in contrast to the status quo? I do not mean to come at this analyses from a ethnocentric perspective, declaring that there are only certain types of legitimate, meaningful rights and liberties; I rather simply to challenge the idea that we can accept these arguments on face-value as compelling. &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The Spanish conquered a lot of territory in South and Central America during the late 1400&amp;#8242;s and early 1500&amp;#8242;s. Their conquests were accomplished because of several variables since they were truly outnumbered by the indigenous populations. Technology played a major role in winning over the natives such as armor, guns and cannons. Horses also helped since the natives hadn&amp;#8217;t really seen them in their daily lives. For the big groups like the Aztecs and Mayans, neighboring groups allied with the Spanish to increase their numbers in order to fight these huge groups off. I would say this was the 2nd biggest contributor to the conquest but the number one reason for Spanish success in the Americas was disease. Small pox and various other diseases spread like wild fire through the indigenous tribes in such huge numbers that within a few decades 90% of the population was gone. All these factors led to the take over of South and central America by the Spanish where they established their own settlements for trade. As time went on and the Spanish colonies grew the indigenous populations that had survived the disease and battles started to integrate into the new society. The Spanish tried to press their customs and ways of life onto these people and tried to set up their own government to aid them. While the indigenous people adapted to these forms of government they still kept their own customs within the disguise of the Spanish way. In one chapter we read in class about wills and testaments for example, the natives used these wills that they did not have before the Spanish as a way to pass down their possessions to their kids. The women would pass on items that only they used in their gender defined society such as garden tools and house items.  Also the leaders they picked for their political offices were the same exact people who led their villages before the Spanish conquest. It was important for these people to keep their practices alive under the disguise of the Spanish customs because it was all they could do against the now dominant&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indigenous groups, such as the Mexica, needed to maintain their customs and ways of life after the Spanish conquests because of the importance of them. Many of their people had died and a lot of their culture wiped out from the conquest and not much could be done about the Spanish so their religion and practices had to be taken. However, the natives learned how to incorporate their customs within the Spanish customs to keep their previous lives and culture&amp;nbsp;intact.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;What kind of thing have did woman in the distant past really have to own?  The answer is not much.  Around the time of the Spanish conquest one would think that upon death, indigenous women would have nothing to pass down to future generations.  This is a misconception, though.  The tradition of passing down of will and testament was brought by the Spaniards to the indigenous people but the indigenous were happy to comply to this form of cultural&amp;nbsp;preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indigenous woman, upon dying actually had a decent amount of land and other material things to pass down to daughters and grandsons.  I am a bit confused as to why the actual sons were looked over in testament and will of women until the Spanish tradition slowly changed that.Regardless of this, the main point is to try to understand why the indigenous women did adapt to the Spanish form of will and&amp;nbsp;testament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy to understand. It was simply to preserve their own culture.  By following the Spanish form of testament, the Nahuatl people passed down pieces of their culture that could stay within family and other indigenous people.  It seems that most of the accounts of testament and will were recorded in Nahuatl language with further proves this idea of cultural&amp;nbsp;preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a couple thoughts on the  naming patterns of the indigenous Nahautl.  First, it almost seems that they were trying to keep any away any chance that their history could be traced.  I say this because the the common switches between first and last names among the people.  As if this was not confusing enough, they decided on middle names too, that would often be changed.  I realize that much of this was based on marriage and the idea of status level based on having a good solid Spanish last name but the continual name changes throughout life seems to me, a little bit&amp;nbsp;excessive.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This week we examined in detail the &amp;#8220;gender norms&amp;#8221; present in colonial Latin America. It was very interesting to finally combine all the things we have been looking at this semester (how things were in pre-conquest &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;, in Spain, and in Africa) into a detailed study of the ultimate focus of this class: The gender relations in early Latin&amp;nbsp;America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was explained on Tuesday, there was a definite difference between prescription and practice. Although a certain lifestyle and value system (female chastity and male virility) was commanded by the Church, there was often a wide gap between what the Church required and actual lives. This brings up the question, &amp;#8220;what was the norm?&amp;#8221; Do we define the &amp;#8220;norm&amp;#8221; as the lifestyle most people in society had, or is the norm the lifestyle that the society viewed as ideal? I believe that the norm has to be defined as the lifestyle that most people had, not the idealized lifestyle. With such an overwhelming majority of the population partaking in a lifestyle other than the idealized one, it is incorrect to cast the idealized lifestyle as the societal norm. To correctly analyze and understand how a society operates, the most important thing to consider is the choices people actually made. Knowing what was viewed as ideal certainly provides insight into some practices of a society, but when a definite majority lives separate from the ideal, it is foolish to take the ideal as the&amp;nbsp;norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday we delved into several of the readings in order to get a better idea of gender relations in the colonies. Peter Carrasco&amp;#8217;s article on marriages in post-conquest &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; particularly caught my eye. According to Carrasco, marriages between Spanish men and indigenous women were by far more frequent than marriages between Spanish women and indigenous men. Furthermore, marriages were primarily used as political tools, both for Spanish men to gain property in the colonies, and for indigenous royal families to become kin with the conquering Spanish (as was their custom). It was only high-up indigenous people who married the Spanish, as well. I think Carrasco makes some good points, but his lack of primary sources is somewhat troublesome. It appears that besides using a primary document or two, Carrasco cites mostly secondary sources. Also, one of the problems with Carrasco&amp;#8217;s article is that he does not take into account Spanish-indigenous relationships that weren&amp;#8217;t between the noble class. I don&amp;#8217;t entirely blame him for it, since there is probably scant evidence of relations that took place between commoners (likely only upper class marriages would be recorded), but if he intends to classify all of the societal gender norms that took place in colonial &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;, it would be incorrect to just examine the noble class. When studying Spain, we saw how Allyson Poska challenged classic views on gender relations by arguing that anthropologists incorrectly assumed elite practices to be the same as all of the Spanish people. In this case, Carrasco might be incorrect in assuming elite practices in colonial &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; were the same as that of all people in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;. I would venture to guess that relations did occur between common Spanish people and common indigenous people in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;, and it is possible that those relations differed greatly from the practices of the&amp;nbsp;elite.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Its funny to me how much my conceptions prior to reading the Gauderman book (and other things this semester) were that life for women in colonial Spanish America was exactly the same as what I thought life was like for women in colonial North America.  I had thought that they were downtrodden, with no rights, subject to tyrannical male authority from the husband on up.  In hindsight maybe basing my opinions solely upon what I gleaned from a rather useless high school text and The Scarlet Letter maybe wasn&amp;#8217;t the wisest choice.  Regardless, Gauderman talks about how women (and children) were relatively independent in colonial society.  Her argument is that the Spanish governing structure, bureaucratic de-centralism, operated at the level of government but also in the structuring of &amp;#8220;colonial social and legal norms&amp;#8221;.  The logic was that absolute authority had to be checked at all levels, even within the family.  So woman had to be able to contest the absolute authority of their husbands.  They used the legal system, and to a lesser extent (and less successfully) the ecclesiastical courts, to contest the behavior of their husbands.  It is really striking how litigious the Spanish were, especially when people today talk about how people will sue over anything, as if its something new.  When one considers this, Spanish women weren&amp;#8217;t as helpless as one might think they&amp;nbsp;were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its interesting to me think about how cultures varied across Europe, and how different Spain was from, say, England.  The English developed a different form of colonial government, had different laws concerning women and children (they had no legal rights and could not own property), different inheritance customs, than the Spanish did.  Yet they&amp;#8217;re both European, and until the mid 1500s had basically the same religion.   It makes Europe seem much less homogeneous than I had previously thought.  In prior weeks we&amp;#8217;ve talked about how slavery varied in the Americas, depending on location and the en-slaver.  The same thing I guess.  My apparently uneducated mind is&amp;nbsp;blown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/joshyapplecider.wordpress.com/33/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=joshyapplecider.wordpress.com&amp;blog=9199002&amp;post=33&amp;subd=joshyapplecider&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;The importance of credit to early modern Spaniards reveals much about the way that their economy and their society worked. The systems of trade based on trust and obligation emphasizes the importance of honor in Spanish culture and its influence on interactions between genders and classes. The general ideas of honor were attached to female chastity and male virility. The reputation of a Spanish woman was to be defended by her male family members at all costs, through the practice of dueling and other legal measures if necessary. This would certainly make it appear that sexual and gender identity was the most important component of honor to the Spanish at this time period. However, as Scott Taylor&amp;#8217;s article points out, the use of credit was just as important to the honor of men and women in early modern Spain as chastity was. The failure to pay a debt or honor a promise could bring about the same violence as an affront to virginity could. In fact, these were more common causes for such duels than slander or accusations of immorality. The entire economy was based largely on honor and the potential of one to repay his debt, and failure to uphold such promises could be damaging to many people. What is most interesting, though, is that in light of the importance of financial honor, the perception of sexual integrity seems to change. In fact, female virginity becomes almost a commodity that can be argued over much as the payment for any other product could be. While gender is important in the conception of honor, particularly among the elites, both men and women have other aspects involved in their social standing, as well as the ability to control such things. Due partly to the militaristic emphasis of the Reconquista, the fight for one&amp;#8217;s integrity and the integrity of family members was a part of life for men and women, and involved every aspect of one&amp;#8217;s reputation, not just the acceptable characteristics of gender.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-7404243394659781589?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;“Your honor, this man told me he loved me, promised to marry me, so we hooked up, then I  got pregnant and he didn’t want me no more. He “deflowered” me and left me for fill in the blank. I think he needs to support his baby and pay me for taking my virginity. Yes, your honor, two donkeys and a sack of beans will do…” No this is not a scene from Divorce Court with Judge Mablean, rather it is the social, religious and judicial system described by Allyson Poska in diocese of Ourense in northwest Spain from the mid sixteenth through eighteenth century. Poska examines the contradiction between the sovereign rules and edicts introduced by the Catholic Church to legislate the institution of marriage and the cultural adaption of said rules by the local clergy. &lt;br /&gt;Poska has a couple of main goals. First, she wants to explain how the act of pablas de presente, the promise of marriage, was actually beneficial to females during this time compared to the church’s view of palabras del future, the actual act of marriage preformed by a priest, took away females rights as the woman simply passed from her father’s hands to her husband; thereby passing her legal rights as well, so she had no hand in the matter. Second, Poska empathizes that the marriage reforms passed by the church actual caused illegitimacy rates to explode in the region, since father’s who had claimed children born out of wedlock faced severe financial punishment by the church itself. Lastly, she explains how the church’s edicts actually created a legal nightmare for both parties; in essence, it punished them if they wanted to break up the relationship. &lt;br /&gt;I found both her articles entirely gripping. She used the church’s own records to prove their edicts were ineffective and essentially took away women’s rights. Since legally, they were either represented by their father or their husband, the pablas de presente actually gave them financial compensation, similar to alimony in modern divorce, thus allowing them to provide for themselves until they found another mate. The male partner had no reason to not claim children from the relationship, thereby giving the child legitimate birth rights and support. Their mutual agreement to dissolve the relationship and support provisions mirror modern mediated agreements. Women and their families also gained familial honor, and my personal favorite, the restoration of the woman’s virginity, through financial restitution; which gave her and the child cultural acceptance rather than shame. However, the church though too much hanky-panky was going on and laid down the law. No more engagement were acceptable, the young couples had to marry, with little to no chances of divorce being granted, and no financial compensation if it was allowed. Then again, what do you expect out of an institution that went on murderous ethnic cleansing sprees in the name of God? Illegitimacy rates skyrocketed as a result and marriage rates plummeted. &lt;br /&gt;I also found it rather interesting that the local priests, some of which had illegitimate children too, continued to practice the pablas de presente rather than the church official policies. Either they were not worried about punishment by the church itself, or they worried more about the welfare and stability of their local parish. Maybe they simply worried about their own chances of having sex, if they enforce the edicts. Either way, their ignoring of the policy, was financially beneficial to women, thereby creating a financial independence outside of inheritance laws that liberated women and was culturally accepted. &lt;br /&gt;The main idea I took away from her essays was that once again, the Catholic Church itself was a biased institution that took away women’s legal rights as well as enforcing stigma’s that did not exist among lower classes prior to its involvement. I also hope that teenagers do not find out about the whole “restoration of virginity through payment”, since there are enough issues with just Facebook pages&amp;#8230;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-7256732346361855985?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <id>/history465/blog/female-chastity-re-examined.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Allyson Poska&amp;#8217;s article &amp;#8220;Elusive Virtue:  Rethinking the Role of Female Chastity in Early Modern Spain&amp;#8221; begins by addressing the standard historian&amp;#8217;s view of how prevalent the principles of female chastity were in early modern Spain.  Poska then spends the remainder of the article strategically refuting this generally accepted historical point.  It seems that over time, scholars have given the principles of female chastity in the early Spanish society much more publicity than they deserve; this may be due to the fact that the majority of the literature &amp;#8212; which, I must add, were written by men &amp;#8212; expressed the views of the upper class and the nobility in relevance to a woman&amp;#8217;s virtue.  However, it also seems that scholars have failed to recognize that these views do not encompass those held by the Spanish peasantry who comprised the majority of the population.  The misconception, however, is understandable considering that one of the most popular texts at the time created an overly dramatic view of the consequences of a woman would reap if she were to lose her chastity.  The article also points out a few other popular literary texts that make absurd claims about how the world would practically end if a woman had forsaken her&amp;nbsp;virginity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another source of error for many early modern historians is rooted in their viewing female chastity from only two frameworks:  the Mediterranean honor code and the Catholic Reformation.  The Mediterranean honor code, as formulated by historians, claimed that &amp;#8220;women derive their honor from preservation of their chastity&amp;#8221; (138).  The Spanish monarchy tried to enforce Christian orthodoxy by controlling prostitution and supposedly aggressively constraining female activity.  Poska is quick to point out the flaws in these two paradigms.  The Mediterranean honor code is said to have been written from an ethnocentric viewpoint by Anglo-Saxons who viewed the Mediterranean societies as unruly.  Other research has shown that the Catholic Reformation may not have been as successful as previously thought in its attempt to control prostitution and other deviant&amp;nbsp;acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poska then delves into the meaty core of her argument when she illustrates the five points for her reasoning that female chastity was not widely valued in early Spain.  The first of these was the fact that there were high rates of celibacy and that if female chastity was of high importance, then the parents of young girls would be hastily arranging marriages of that.  This, however, was not the case with the peasantry.  The second point demonstrated that there is exists little evidence of an attempt to disengage females from contact with males.  In fact, the economy was dependent upon the interactions between men and women of the peasantry.  The third point showed the often high rates of illegitimate pregnancies and prenuptial sex.  The fourth indicated that the law did in fact provide protection for women to sue men for taking their virginity if the two were previously involved with each other and the man resolved to leave the woman.  The last point attacks the idea that women would be permanently damaged for losing their chastity, but Poska points out that the illegitimate children oftentimes lead normal lives and that peasant women were most likely valued more for their skills than their&amp;nbsp;chastity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Poska&amp;#8217;s debunking the ideals of female chastity as an overwhelming entity provided for a more truthful viewpoint of early Spanish society.  She is effective in her argument, yet hasty to fully accept any viewpoint without addressing the&amp;nbsp;caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This week we talked about the institute of marriage and how the views of marriage today greatly differs from the views of marriage from the Spanish between the 15th to the 17th Centuries. During those times, marriage was viewed very seriously and sacred because it was something that God created so that man would not be alone. Therefore, Divorce was considered a sin since Spain was under the Catholic Church. This is why Divorce was rarely heard of and if so had to be proven through certain laws. One of these laws to prove that the marriage partner was impudent or that the two were related in a close matter. This would nullify the marriage because the marriage would be deemed not a holy marriage to begin with in the first place. However, for instance if the woman could not prove that the marriage was not a holy marriage, she could decide to enter the nunnery and vice versa for the man to enter the monastery. Also these laws were also there to protect women from being taken of from men that only wanted to marry them for just sexual reason. If a man married a woman just for just sexual reason and left the woman , would have to face a judge for this act. For this act would compare to how in today&amp;#8217;s culture if a man fathered a child would have to go to court to face having to pay child support to the woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, marriage was viewed as a sacred bond between two people that honor this bond and understood the importance of such an act. However, if one or both of the partners wanted to leave the marriage, there were laws placed that could help one or both of partners escape an unholy marriage. Also there were laws for people that took advantage of marriage and if found out would have to face charges and be seen as committing a sin within their community .&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/811234197297643948-8105872668058101229?l=ras2011.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt; Of the four articles that we read for our classes this previous week, the one that stood out to me the most was “When Love Goes Wrong.”  I have always found taken great interest in legally related topics, and this particular article was particularly intriguing because it delved into divorce from a unique perspective which I had been previously unexposed to.  The rural town in which the author studied historical cases of divorce was at a very interesting crossroads in time and society.  While cultural practices had historically dictated the process of marital bonding and separation, the ascension of the reforming Catholic Church as the source of moral, and often legal, authority was coupled with the time studied and thus greatly impacted the systemizing and outcome of many aforementioned cases.&lt;br /&gt;
    Before the establishment of the importance of the Catholic Church in rural Spanish communities such as this, public declarations of commitment sufficed for local standards of constituting a marriage.  Unsurprisingly, consenting spouses also withheld the basic right to sever their marital ties, without excessive societal, legal, or religious ramifications.  Providing that the female could supply sufficient reasoning, a male would often be required to give reasonable, but not drastic, economical support to his former partner.  These reasons varied but were rarely beyond the context of what could be expected, such as provision for a child born in or out of wedlock, infidelity, etc…&lt;br /&gt;
    However, at the junction of Catholicism’s arrival as the undisputed source of bottom-line moral and legal guidelines by which society was to conduct itself, things became at the very least more complicated.  Because there was, and still is, no means of marital separation which can be condoned by the Catholic Church, temporary physical separation was the only acceptable alternative that the Church could present to the people of this time.  I personally presume that this practice would largely be an ineffective waste of time for all parties involved.  Should a consenting couple truly wish to end their ties, then I see fail to see what could prevent them from doing so.&lt;br /&gt;
    My overall feeling upon reading the article was that the while the Catholic Church was a fundamental pillar in the lives of many from this time/community, it served mostly (in this matter at least) as an imposing complication.  I find that the older native practices served a greater amount of justice and was more slanted towards fairness.  It took circumstances into greater account in that the judicial system could fairly assess each case presented and determine how to handle it.  The stricter laws of the Catholic Church seemed concerned only in what the Bible said in a literal sense.  The consolidation of innumerous contributing variables, which ultimately caused unsuccessful marriages, into a single scenario grouping seems foolish to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Allyson Poska&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;When Love Goes Wrong&amp;#8221; discusses how local laws protected  under the Fuero came in contact under the watchful eyes of the Catholic Reformation Church, what could marriage be other than righteous and just (and therefore strictly adherent to church law)? In small Spanish diocese like Ourense, far away from the the secular and ecclesiastical powers, marriage was more an act of tradition than an act of religious fervor. As such, the peasants of Ourense ultimately cared very little for the Catholic Reformation Church&amp;#8217;s opinions on the act of marital union. Most marriages followed traditional formats, with a private or semi-public exchange of a marriage promise being enough to bind a legal marriage. However, due to the schism in marital beliefs between the Reformation Church and the rural Spanish population served only to blur the line between a &amp;#8220;legal&amp;#8221; marriage or an &amp;#8220;illegal&amp;#8221; marriage and allowed the rural population to take advantage of various loopholes in marital law. For instance, the church recommended (forced?) the population to eventually make their marriage promise &amp;#8220;legal&amp;#8221; by giving it in front of a priest. Almost all of the population eventually did confirm their vows in front of a priest, but many considered themselves married for some time before doing so on private vows alone. This blurred the line between married and unmarried in many people&amp;#8217;s eyes simply because what was once considered a binding oath could be considered an illegitimate promise simply because of the lack of a priest&amp;#8217;s presence. Ironically, because of this action taken by the Catholic Reformation Church (who happened to be firmly against divorce and considered marriages permanently and spiritually binding) many couples were allowed to separate under allegations of false pretenses. Those legally married in the eyes of the church had a harder time with separation. To be frank, in the eyes of the church it was impossible. Most had to deal with it by way of physical separation, usually by fleeing secretly. However, there were loopholes even in the Church&amp;#8217;s draconian divorce laws. For instance, the Church was strictly against forced marriages and didn&amp;#8217;t consider them binding. The Church also would annul marriages if one or both of the wedded desired to take up the cloth. Because of local tradition and differing cultural beliefs from those of the governing Reformation Church, most of the people living in these rural areas were rather promiscuous. The rate of illegitimacy was between five and ten percent, much larger than the two percent boasted by a large part of Europe. All of this shows that although the Catholic Reformation Church was strict and staunch in its lawmaking, cultural flair around Europe (especially in areas far from the concentrated areas of power) could not be completely stamped&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The institute of marriage is one which is highly contested in modern culture, mainly the situation of who may marry, but no one outside of the church raises the question of whom may get divorced. in the 15th to the 17th Centuries the issue of divorce was a hot topic. in the 15th to 17th Centuries marriage was a sacred and inseparable bond that no one could break save God. to put aside a marriage by divorce was not only incredibly hard it was considered a sin, and in a culture largely governed by the church and religious practice, this was more important than law. in Spain however, there were numerous laws governing what situations allowed a divorce, such as the inability to have children, or if it could be proven the marriage was forced. a forced marriage could be nullified based on the fact that it was not a true holy marriage in the eyes of God because it was not take willingly. it would be difficult to prove a marriage was taken unwillingly if the victim had less witnesses than their souse or more feasibly none at all. the law did have a way out even for this however because divorce was allowed should one of the spouses choose to enter religious service in a monastery or convent. so even if a woman had no way of proving her marriage had been forced upon her she could instead take up the lesser of two solitudes by entering a nunnery. a life in the service of God, even if it was not the individuals first choice, would be far better than the prison of a forced marriage. the case of breaking a marriage went both ways however the laws did not work only for unhappy women but their were laws which protected women from adulterous and conniving men who would try to leave them after having had their way with the woman. a man who would attempt to cheat marriage by seducing the woman with promises of marriage to get her into bed and then leave would more than likely find themselves before a judge much like a man who fathered a child in today&amp;#8217;s culture would if he tried to ditch the child and mother. unlike todays culture however instead of paying continual child support payments the man would pay a single settlement for his misdeed of either betraying his spouse or drastically changing a woman&amp;#8217;s life after having seduced her. the Spain of the 15th and 17th Centuries differed from other countries in that it did provide laws for divorce, a way out if the couple was not happy.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7292399274560322422-1091749443542368149?l=asfhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Excellent Post! I really liked the last point that you made about the difference in potential gender fluidity between men and women, and I think that this difference is really critical to an understanding of gender in today&amp;#8217;s society.  In the wake of the presumed liberation of women, females in our society are put in a position of having to express both femininity and masculinity in order to survive.  They must be able to compete with men in male-dominated fields, but also must present a display of femininity in order to avoid the slew of derogatory words used to describe women that do not display such femininity.  In short, to survive in a supposedly liberated society (and I stress the &amp;#8220;supposed&amp;#8221; nature of this liberation for obvious reasons), women must synthesize both the masculine and the feminine into a unified identity.  For men, however, only displays of masculinity are valued.  What I&amp;#8217;m basically saying is that, even though we live in a society that claims to be egalitarian in terms of gender, gender is valued in the scale of masculinity, there is no space in which feminine attributes, and I mean genuinely feminine attributes, not the aspects of femininity that have been favorably appraised by men, are considered valuable.  A woman has to in some way embody androgyny in order to be considered successful as a&amp;nbsp;woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip-side of this, femininity is not valued in men, and therefore men must only display that which is masculine in order to be seen as successful.  This mirrors the situation in early Spain, in which it was considered a positive thing, a social promotion if you will, for a woman to be regarded as a man, but if a man does not measure up to the expectations of masculinity, he is robbed of his manhood, essentially receiving an incredibly humiliating social demotion.  I think it is interesting that this same structure of gender fluidity, in which only movement in one direction, towards the masculine, is considered favorable, still can be seen in today&amp;#8217;s presumably gender-liberated&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The trans-Atlantic slave trade was undoubtedly one of the most severe abominations committed against humanity in the history of mankind.  To sell, own, and slave a person as if they were an animal or a piece of property is unfathomable in modern times.  Several interesting facets exist in regards to the co-existence of the Spaniards, slaves, and indigenous peoples in Central America during the 1500s such as the relationship between the indigenous peoples and the slaves, the labor assignments for slaves, and the general treatment of slaves during the Middle Passage and as laborers in Brazil.  However, in relevance to the topic of this class, I will focus on the abusive treatment of the slaves and further argue that female slaves were objectified more than the&amp;nbsp;males.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial capture of the slaves in Africa was almost always violent, thus paving the road to a long process of brutality for each enslaved individual.  Slaves were then packed onto ships like sardines in a can and left to bathe in their own excrement and endure the disease-ridden environment.  Any captive infected with a disease was cast overboard.  They were beaten and force-fed, and once the journey was over, they were auctioned off and provided with a shiny new Christian name.  However, documents have shown that many of the female captives were unnamed significantly more often than the&amp;nbsp;males.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the slaves were established as laborers in Brazil, a new slew of mistreatment began.  The male slaves often were highly trained in the certain trades but were never allowed to progress to the level of joining a guild, despite how talented the might have been.  The slaves were often subjected to brutality for disobeying their masters and sometimes were executed for the same misdemeanors.  Female slaves were subjected to the same conditions as the males but they also had to endure being used as sex slaves by their masters, and oftentimes, this would lead to illegitimate pregnancies.  The slaves were raped of their culture and identity; many slaves from different regions of Africa had to work together and they had to adjust to a common language that they could all use to communicate.  They were stripped of their traditional spiritual values while the religious views of the Spaniards were forced upon them.  The physical and emotional abuse was endless.  Additionally, women were further subjected to emotional abuse by serving as wet-nurses.  To breastfeed a child and form a bond only to have the child ripped away would be incredibly emotionally&amp;nbsp;tortuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a group, their identities were stolen from them, as well as their dignity, humanity, and freedom.  As separate sexes, each category of slaves had different pressures to endure, but in my opinion, the female slaves had much more emotional abuse to&amp;nbsp;endure.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking previously into Spaniard conquests in Latin America and the changes they brought with them, one would assume that women had little rights in Spain, as they did in their newly conquest territories.  However, I was surprised to read that the women had many legal rights (some which they took advantage of).  This was probably because of the model of Ferdinand and Isabella, where Isabella seemed to be the “head of the household” because she kept her land separate and had much more of it than her husband.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:arial;&#34;&gt;Focusing on the article by Edward Behrend-Martinez titled, &amp;#8220;Manhood and the Neutered Body in Early Modern Spain&amp;#8221;, it was interesting to read about how “manhood” was defined in early Spain.  I was surprised to read how much pressure was on men to prove their masculinity, physically and in conduct.  The pressure to have the ability to perform sexually and be potent male was extremely heavy because it seemed to be the whole community’s duty to find out about a man’s private life and broadcast it to the whole community.  They felt it necessary to “warn the public” of a male’s incomplete anatomy or lack of ability to perform in reproduction, so that he would not fool an unsuspecting woman into marrying “imperfect man”.  I did not realize how private our society is until I read how transparently public this society was involving the intimate details of a man’s and couple’s private life.  This public openness was used by the Catholic Church as a way to “control the public sphere to participate in the economy of sexual reputation”, and to curtail men from deceitfully getting into relationships with women who assumed their competence.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:arial;&#34;&gt;It was also interesting to read about the case of Juan, who was born a hermaphrodite and considered an outcast in the community.  S/he was considered a monster and an outcast.  When Juan showed interest in living as a male, it worried family members, who viewed it as unnatural.  Even though it seemed Juan chose his own sexuality, as a man, the court ordered Juan to live as a female and required Juan to remain celibate.  I felt sorry for Juan that the court chose his sexuality instead of accepting the way Juan wanted to live, whether it be male female, or as both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:arial;&#34;&gt;Reading from the Spaniards’ point of view was good because it gave me the whole picture about the influences early Latin America had and the reasons as to why and how they ruled when they came to Latin America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4551310302796999455-280709013121331750?l=laurenhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;After going over a few of the readings this week I got a good insight of what it was like for the Spanish during the 1700’s, in the form of males and females.  It was very interesting to me that some of the Spanish women had the right to own land.  This is something that I was not expecting to learn, after learning how some of the women in Latin America were treated and for them not having too many rights.  I guess this is one example of how some of the Spaniards viewed the Indians from Latin America.  I understand that Spanish women did not have as many rights and the Spanish men, but I think it is impressive for that time period.  Another interesting thing I have leaned from the readings this week was how many females in Spain were treated in the courts.  For the most part it was very difficult to get a divorce in Spain, due to the fact that the Catholic Church has many rules for divorce, but the women seemed to be more believable than the males at that time, in others words they favored the women over the man.  The women also could clam rape when they cheated on their husbands, which I know did not always work, but the fact she could get away with it, is surprising.  I liked how Spain at that time was a mix of different cultures and had a major influence on the Spanish government. Which seems to be why many Spanish women had more rights than other countries at that time.  It kind of reminds me of the U.S., a mixture of different cultures coming together and creating a good government.  You can argue that we have a bad government but we are far better off than most.  Some other interesting reads from this week was how the Spanish viewed masculine men.  Martinez pointed out that to be a masculine male you needed a deep voice, strong, bold, ect.  Which does not seem to be so different in America today, but the part that caught me off guard was now they would castrate some boys to get the “perfect voice.”  This seems to contradict what they say a man is, because that is overall what a man really is.  It is also very interesting to see that for the most part what it is to be a masculine male has not changed much in time and seems to be the same all over the world.  This point may also explain that most men from where ever they are from and what time period they lived in, they can have natural acts and drives that they are born with, and instilled in their&amp;nbsp;minds.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div&gt;Perhaps the most significant period in Spanish history is the Reconquista, the reclamation of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors, significant due to the lasting legacy imposed by the nature of this reclamation and the system and style of power distribution that proceeded in its wake. As noted in analyzing the divided unification of kingdoms through the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabel, the manner of their marriage union while maintaining separate dominions influenced the manner of rule upheld as a unified Spain, or rather a unified state of many autonomous and distinct Spains. This greatly reflected the historical development of communities under Moorish rule, with isolated communities in the North functioning independently of one another. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Through this style of development, distinct cultural and political communities grew, and the manner of the unification of Spain through Ferdinand and Isabel’s marriage furthered and perpetuated the creation and upholding of these distinct communities. Further, having noted the connection between the decentralized monarchical rule and that between the state and local communities, these forces of decentralization as historical and cultural influences penetrated to the systems of governance, power, and honor within the community and within the home. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This decentralization is particularly evident through the adoption of fueros, negotiations of special rights and legal practices that demonstrated the authority of the Crown but also the authority of the kingdom (and even local community). Fueros indicated that legitimate authority was bound by negotiated consent. However, due to constraints of geographic rule, flexibility and autonomy most ignorantly characterize the Spanish governance system in this period; this included both fueros and local lack of enforcement of national policies promoted through the monarch (directly or indirectly), including policies and expectations of the Catholic Church. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;One of the most glaring examples of this decentralized political, cultural system is the promotion of “proper” values, principally the independent consideration of virtue as the central contributor to a woman’s sense of honor. Formerly, analyzing early modern Spanish values through literature produced in the period as well as the influences of the Catholic Reformation, scholars firmly believed that female chastity was central to conceptions of both male and female cultural models, as the texts of the time supported the notion that women were weak and sinful and that marriage served a positive purpose both for individuals and society in a woman’s subservience to her husband (Poska 136-138). &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, as noted by Poska in “Elusive Virtue: Rethinking the Role of Female Chastity in Early Modern Spain,” it seems clear that this value, promoted by the Church and upheld in elite writing of the time, does not accurately reflect local beliefs and practices, as women often did not marry, women were not socially isolated from men to promote chastity and further the male sense of honor, documentation supporting the frequency of prenuptial sex is extensive, and yet this documentation, including legal documents and social contracts, does not suggest that female sexual behavior carried with it a social stigma. Poska declares that there was a “significant disjunction between early modern rhetoric and sexual practice. The restrictive discourse on female sexuality and honor favored by Spanish elites and enthusiastically instigated by the early modern historians had little resonance among the majority of the Spanish population” (136). Poska’s ideas about how this cultural more should be reexamined, considering demographics, economics, class distinctions, and regional differentiation, are particularly interesting. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In line with Scott’s “Credit, Debt, and Honor in Castille, 1600-1650,” Poska demonstrates that female virtue depended much more upon a woman’s economic value, such as her access to credit, than upon chastity. These practices directly contradict the sense of gendered virtue promoted by the Church and state and support the idea of both cultural and political decentralization in Spain, with communities designating their own values. As Polska stated in regards to this, “Only as we study early modern people in their own context, neither completely isolated from larger societal issues not completely subordinated to them, can we come to a better understanding of women’s roles, women’s bodies, and the complex social forces on their lives” (Poska 146). &lt;/div&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Spain was occupied by many different groups during the 15th century, about 7 or so major ones. Aragon and Castile were two of the major kingdoms whose rulers became married to one another. Mostly an agreement between the two these rulers still stayed within their kingdoms and ruled separate from each other. Because of all these groups and the influence of the two major groups Spain became a very mixed place in terms of culture, laws and religion. Marriage was one of those things that was run culturally but would soon be backed up by the institute of religion to back up the promises of the partners. Spain was special in this regard because unlike in many European countries where woman had limited rights, Spain allowed a lot more flexibility to both parties. In the article by Allyson M. Poska marriage in 17th century Spain was greatly influenced by the Catholic Church because marriage was a sacred institution. So legally once a marriage was made between two people in the presence of a priest it could not be broken but under the most specific circumstances. For those that were not married but promised to marry still ran into problems as most of them were promised to receive sex from the other person and then ditched afterward.  But what sets Spain apart from other places is the amount of justice a woman or man can receive based on the presented evidence. Like a man could not promise marriage and have sex with a woman who then became pregnant and was left to raise the child. Like today, they would go before the court and in many cases the man would have to compensate the woman for putting her in this situation. The same practice applied to adulterers who wanted to leave their partners for another man or woman. Many times these compensations would not be in the form of money because many were poor so instead materials would be given instead such as aprons or cloth materials. Sometimes women tried to use the excuse of rape or that they didn&amp;#8217;t consent to the marriage but this didn&amp;#8217;t always work especially if their were any witnesses to their promised marriage together. Married couples had a harder time dealing with bad relationships because as mentioned before they could not separate by law. Often times the two would just separate from each other physically without any legal means but this led to both parties eventually getting back together. In rare cases a marriage could be granted separation if the woman could not bear a child which was the purpose of marriage, if one of the partners wanted to take up religious order or if the marriage was forced somehow. So women in Spain had a lot of room to operate within the legal system where often in history they did not have any rights. it just goes to show the importance of the females in Spain and how that would soon effect the countries they conquered later in&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;After learning about the Indigenous and African communities and their own gender relations that were severely altered after the Spanish invasions, it was actually nice to learn about the other side of the coin, the Spaniards themselves. To actually read and learn a little about the Spaniards own ideas of gender and its roles would possibly help explain to me the shifts that were seen as Indigenous and African communities&amp;#8217; own gender relations were completely uprooted. I was expecting to see this major patriachical system among the Spanish due to the seemingly lack of women&amp;#8217;s rights among these uprooted communities, even though both men and women from these communities basically had no rights, but was surprised to read about the property and legal rights of women in Spain! Who would have known? But, as easy as it would be for me to discuss women&amp;#8217;s roles and rights (it&amp;#8217;s clearly a favorite theme of mine), I&amp;#8217;d like to focus on the&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In saying that, if anyone hasn&amp;#8217;t read Edward Behrend-Martinez&amp;#8217;s article about manhood and the male body, then do it! This was so interesting, and I think that for someone like me, for instance, it&amp;#8217;s always interesting to see how the male body is discussed and objectified since normally we focus on women. Thus, I was very enthuised with what was in store. I think there are many standards that men have to uphold or reach in order to express &amp;#8220;masculinity&amp;#8221; that are equal to women expressing &amp;#8220;femininity,&amp;#8221; allthough in different forms. Martinez really revealed how Spain upheld what it meant to be a man, and deviating from this norm had significant consequences. I was utterly blown away about men having to prove their sexuality by mere physical genitalia, and at the same time, was impressed with the accounts of many women getting by living their lives as men by acting like a &amp;#8220;man&amp;#8221; should even though they obviously lacked the correct genitalia. Clearly, not being able to perform sexually was pertinent to being a Spanish man, and in fact, it was important in solidifying marriage through actual&amp;nbsp;intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martinez also pointed out castration that existed in this culture, and how it was used alot of time to keep men in the choir! Of course, if a man was castrated then, their manhood in the eyes of Spain was nonexistent, so I did not really understand why young boys were castrated to the extent of retaining a good voice if so much of their future lives through manhood was at stake. However, all of these insights that Martinez revealed really begged the question as to how we define manhood today and whether or not many differences are&amp;nbsp;apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish saw manhood in physicality through muscularity, deep voices, chest hair, and of course the penis, if not being the major signifier of manhood. Sometimes I think that being a &amp;#8220;man&amp;#8221; in our own culture today hasn&amp;#8217;t really changed much. I mean, yes, I do believe that we have more gender fluidity, for more women than men, but still men have a little more access I would hope to notions of gender than Spanish men did. Still, though, doesn&amp;#8217;t this macho masculinity still exist somewhat in our own culture? I think because we still have this ultimate masculinity that men are somehow supposed to express really suppresses men&amp;#8217;s ability to have fluidity in gender, while women, on the other hand, due to being feminine (somehow less than being masculine) have much more gender fluidity. I feel a little everywhere with this blog, but Martinez highlighted some interesting points about masculinity, and that can sometimes go unsaid when discussing gender and its&amp;nbsp;roles.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This week we finally got a glimpse of the gender relations that existed in Spain, who were conquering Latin America. It was interesting to see how the gender structure formed in Spain through the reconquering of the peninsula from the Muslims, which finally was accomplished with Ferdinand and Isabella. It was also interesting to note how unexpectedly different the gender roles were in Spain in contrast to the rest of Europe. The &amp;#8220;decentralized monarchy&amp;#8221; that came about as a result of the Reconquista directly influenced the roles and rights of men and women. The fact that both women and men had private property, legal rights, and more was a reflection of the rule of Ferdinand and Isabella, since they did not combine their property, yet maintained individual rule of specific areas of Spain. Perhaps knowledge of this social structure in Spain can be traced to the system the Spanish conquistadors implemented in their conquered regions of Latin&amp;nbsp;America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now turn my attention to one of the articles for this past week by Allyson Poska. In it she is challenging the traditional notion that female chastity was of the utmost important in Spanish gender relations. The traditional view does seem to make some logical sense, since the Iberian Peninsula at this point was a site of intense Catholicism. Even as we discussed in class, the very idea that the Muslims (and Jews) needed to be expelled from the Peninsula came about because they were not Catholic but were heathens. However, Poska very adeptly presents several pieces of evidence that suggests anthropologists may have incorrectly cast the practices of the minority elites on the majority of Spaniards. She mentions celibacy rates, legal rights for sexually active women, and illegitimacy rates among other things as proof that in fact most Spaniards did not value chastity in women as previously they were thought&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty critical analysis, as it has huge repercussions on the role of women in relation to men. Whereas under the Catholic system of chastity a women might be shamed and ridiculed by having premarital relations, if it were true that chastity was not all that important, attitudes towards sex for both men and women would have been on more equal footing. Instead of a women being limited by the &amp;#8220;Mediterranean honor code&amp;#8221;, they could achieve honor from less sexist pursuits. Of course there were still clearly defined roles for men and women, these roles were more equivalent and absent of the sexual prejudice geared towards women under the Catholic chastity&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Allyson M. Poska, in her article “When Love Goes Wrong: Getting out of Marriage in Seventeenth Century Spain,” challenged some preconceived notions of relationships, divorce, and pre-marital sex early Spain.  The Catholic Church’s official position on marriage and divorce was fixed during the reformation at the Council of Trent. Through a decree entitled the &lt;em&gt;Tametsi &lt;/em&gt;, the Church established a uniform set of rituals meant to be followed across the globe. Before this decree, it had been the practice in Europe that all a couple needed was a “consensual marriage promise and sexual intercourse,” to be legitimately married. Now, however, the Church declared a couple must announce publicly on three separate occasions their intentions to marry at least two weeks prior to the actual wedding. Then the marriage must take place in the presence of a priest, much like the ceremonies we experience today. Divorce was not an option according to Catholic Doctrine, and chastity especially among women was to be closely guarded. The position the Catholic Church took on marriage was not new, and there had been many similar decrees in the past, even among smaller parishes, but it turns out enforcing these decrees was a whole other matter&amp;nbsp;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                Poska focuses her article on a small diocese in northwestern Spain called Ourense. This was a village far from the governing hand of Rome and the secular powers of Spain. After the reconquest of Spain, most cities were left to govern themselves much as they had before, with some amount of autonomy.  Ourense was no exception and took the decrees sent from Rome with a grain of salt. Tradition after all, is not easily dislodged, especially when it allowed women and men the freedom of choice and the laxity of divorce should one’s partner prove to be undesirable. Though the&lt;em&gt; Tametsi&lt;/em&gt; would eventually take hold, it would be some time before communities across the board paid them heed. There were attempts to regulate and enforce the doctrine through means of the Inquisition and “regular Parish visitations,” but with the people and even some of the priests themselves holding onto tradition the task was not&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                I think the common belief among historians was that there was a strict moral standard women of early Spain were expected to adhere to, and this might have been the case for the upper class, but the majority of people lived a much freer lifestyle. Sexual activity among couples merely promised to each other was readily accepted and such a promise, whether made in front of a priest or not would hold up in court. That is not to say that the people blatantly ignored the Church’s decrees but that they allowed room for human error within relationships. It was often the case that a couple would make a promise to each other, live together, and have children and then one person decided they, in fact, did not want to marry. In such a case the woman usually went before a judge or priest where the father of any children would pay money for their care and was then absolved of any ties to the woman and vice versa.  After the separation was taken care of both partners were free to marry&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                Though technically divorce once officially married was not possible, it was often found that couples who had married were living separately with no condemnation from the community. In order to better enforce the Catholic Church’s stance on marriage Episcopal visitors were sent to the towns and investigated couples said to be married but living separately. The married couples would then be forced to return to each other and often faced fines. If someone were to disobey such as order they would possible face denunciation before the&amp;nbsp;inquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                Poska states it is difficult to know exactly how frequently these sorts of situations occurred, but it was clearly generally accepted enough to question the previous assumptions made about relationships in seventeenth century&amp;nbsp;Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;First imagine a young single parent, with an infant, having to depend on an impetuous momma’s boy who turns his back on her, rather than acknowledge either the young woman or the child. Now when the child is first born, the young man signs the baby’s birth certificate and provides a home and financial support to the mother and their baby. Suddenly, the young man’s family finds out that he has fathered a child with a woman they consider both racially and socially inferior and he then turns his back on his child and the young mother. Outraged by the young man’s denials and failure to follow through on his promises, she takes what little money she has and hires and attorney to plead her case.  &lt;br /&gt;     The image above resonates throughout the halls of child support courts every day. Yet, hers is unique. Why? This modern day narrative actually took place one hundred and eight six years ago. The young woman, a slave named Angela Bastallas, began a sexual relationship with her owner, Ildefonso Coronel, only after he promised her freedom in exchange. Soon after she become pregnant and bore him a daughter; a daughter for which he willingly signed what would be considered today as her birth certificate. He failed to mention to the mid-wife caring for Angela that the baby was born to a slave mother. He provided both financial support and for a home for the two, along with providing for a servant. However, when the affair became too humiliating for his well- too –do family, Coronel began denying Angela and their child. Furious, Angela defied not only social norms, but also attacked legally against the institution of slavery (and irresponsible fathers). She was able to hire her own attorney, again upsetting the status quo, and even pleaded her case before Simon Bolivar for his support publically.  &lt;br /&gt;     I find this case interesting for many reasons. First, that she was able to win her case, and as a direct result, her freedom and support. Though Camilla Townsend does not directly tie this to any one reason, she does give a few important factors; Coronel signing the baptismal certificate for example. Angela was not only able to have one witness, but rather, she had five, all of whom the court found credible; this too was unheard of during the time, especially for a female slave. It too should be noted that because Coronel had signed the certificate, his daughter was automatically free and did not have to wait until her eighteenth birthday as the designated by law. &lt;br /&gt;     Secondly, Angela gained her rights because she used the law against itself, and therefore, against Coronel. Her argument that because she and Coronel had created a child together, they were joined in union and thereby took on the status of the other; whether that meant she was free or he was part slave. That argument was combined with the issue of enlightenment socially with regards to slavery and Coronel own beliefs, which had been the basis for the consummation of their sexual relationship, and therefore, the basis for her “earned” freedom. &lt;br /&gt;     I find it ironic that Angela was able to gain her freedom and support for her child nearly two hundred years ago against a male that even the Public Defender called a “miserable man without principles” . A slave, promised her freedom, was able to gain it, and today single mother like myself, have to still fight against irresponsible, insolent fathers, who can control the lives of both their children and the mother, legally; otherwise known as modern day “marital” slavery. This might also be one of the first modern day child support cases in the Americas. Angela Basllatas is my new hero!&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-6290443215655444945?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;In modern times, with the knowledge that we have about the horrors of slavery, it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem that it could in any way be reconciled with a Christian worldview. At the time of the slave trade, however, Europeans who bought, sold, and owned slaves found excuses for doing so in the Bible. The very Scriptures that would eventually be used in the cause of abolition were misconstrued in order to support human trafficking and violence to unknown people groups. The professed rationale and the true motives behind this terrible enterprise reveal a lot about the Europeans who developed the slave trade and the effect it had on African slaves in South America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Europeans looking for justification for slavery often claimed that, much as they were &amp;#8220;civilizing&amp;#8221; the natives that they encountered in the Americas by changing their culture and religion, they were helping the slaves by bringing them to a New World and teaching them about Christianity. This might have given some comfort to nobles who had concerns about the practice. However, the slave trade began as purely a financial venture, used to serve the needs of the Portuguese on their sugar plantations and other ventures that required more human labor than they could provide. Racial dynamics were not necessarily involved in the original capture of African slaves. In fact, African tribes helped the Portuguese by trading enemy prisoners for European products. While the Portuguese felt themselves superior to the Africans, it was as much due to their access to modern weapons and military power as it was to supremest ideas of religion and societal interactions. They merely understood that slaves taken out of their home to an unfamiliar world would be easier to subdue than those forced to work in their native environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Africans brought to North and South America had similar experiences in their capture and transportation across the Atlantic, the cultures that they developed were surprisingly different. The number of slaves sold in Latin America was enormous compared to the number sold in the North, especially since the slave trade came to South America and the Caribbean about a century before the first slaves arrived in Jamestown. Due to the size of the African population in South America, the slaves retained more of their African culture, and relied perhaps even more heavily than before on the mystical, magical elements of their religions and societal interactions as a way of coping with the atrocities they faced. Even as generations were born in the Americas, this retention of African sensibilities affected the way the slaves interacted with the other people groups in Latin America and led to a unique subculture that has lasted into modern times&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-4799778918088021049?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;So recently we discussed the African element in Latin America.  For some countries this influence would prove to be powerful in shaping their countries culture.  For Brazil, the African element would be enormous.  As we know the portuguese, due to the control of the gold coast by settlements at Cabo Verde, controlled the African Slave Trade.  Due to this a higher percentage of slaves went to Brazil, Portugal&amp;#8217;s only Latin American&amp;nbsp;colony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know of the horrors that came along with slavery.  The article &amp;#8220;The Children of God&amp;#8217;s Fire&amp;#8221; does a good job portraying some of these atrocities.  It was written in the prospective of a portuguese doctor in 1793.  He describes the scare tactics used to keep the slaves aboard the middle passage in-order.  He explains that at no time are the Africans safe from the portuguese, while beatings and whippings are used to keep the Africans&amp;nbsp;subordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These slaves were sent to Brazil for economic purposes, such as farming sugar cane, mining, etc.  Women who could not due labor were used as nannies and house servants.  These women slaves would be important for the creation of the Brazilian Portuguese.  These slave nannies would care for and feed for the masters&amp;#8217; children.  These nannies would be the first contact with language that these next generation colonial brazilians would have.  So along with portuguese words and broken grammar, naturally, African words would be passed along as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAny scholars argue as to the levels of inhumanity associated with Latin American slavery.  Some argue that slaves did not have it as hard in Latin America as in the North.  Well still one can not deny the horrors of the trade as well as the ownership of humans.  In Brazil folklure tells us of a buitiful black slave women named Chica da Silva, who uses her body to win over the heart of João Fernandes de Oliveira, a portuguese sent by the crown to regulate diamonds in the Brazilian State of Minas&amp;nbsp;Gerais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-align:center; display: block;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://natureofleft.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/8/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://img.youtube.com/vi/28zLhiVgG4U/2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a segment of Cacá Diegues film Xica da Silva(1976).  Keep in mind the african elements shown here.  Most notably the music and the&amp;nbsp;dress.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Since Brazil is really my area of interest in Latin America, I decided to write about the Portuguese Slave Trade and slavery in Brazil in general. Brazil is the one country who imported the most slaves during the slave trade. At a staggering 3 million + slaves imported, the Portuguese slave traders realized that by bring slaves to Brazil, they would increase their own wealth. The document about slavery in Brazil contains writings from different types of people concerning the slaves in Brazil, and how they were treated. In the first part, a Portuguese doctor gave a lecture about the conditions of the enslaved Africans. Coming from a medical viewpoint, the doctor points out the horrible living conditions that the slaves endured on the ships. They were packed in cramped spaces with insufficient water and food supplies. When one slave got sick, the illness often spread to others in an epidemic. Because of this, sick slaves were thrown overboard like damaged goods (which is exactly how the slave traders thought of them). A British clergyman who visited Brazil in the 1800s also wrote about the slaves. He saw the slave market in Rio de Janeiro and witnessed how the slaves were treated like animals rather than humans. Prospective customers went to the market to examine the slaves before making a purchase. &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This document also contains newspaper articles from Brazil where people advertised the fact that they were looking to sell or rent out a female slave to serve as a wet nurse. This once again shows how the African slaves were viewed as subhuman in Brazilian society. A French doctor even advises women on how to select a slave as a wet nurse. The doctor states that while everyone would much rather have a white woman as a wet nurse, the African women are more accustomed to the tropical climate and, therefore, are better prospects as a wet nurse. However, to prevent the nursing child from contracting a disease, the slave woman was thoroughly inspected and only when found to be free of defect, purchased as a wet nurse. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Besides the hardships that slaves had to endure in transport and the selling process, they also were often mistreated by their owners. In the case of the 12 year old slave girl being sexually abused by her master. Although there was sufficient evidence that the rape had occurred, the court still ruled in favor of the master. Giving him the right to sexually abuse her if he wanted to. To me, it is completely disgusting to see that a court of law would legally allow a person to rape another and receive no punishment for it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Thankfully slavery has been abolished in Brazil, but the effects of slavery still linger in the multi-racial society. Blacks are often barred from moving up in society because of their skin color. Black women especially are stuck in the domestic labor force of society, and having difficulties finding any other jobs. While the government often proclaims that Brazil is a racial  democracy, this is not the case. This is a direct result of the slave trade that existed in the colonial period. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4101372912891888807-1872088782422026550?l=alegria-tristeza-history465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt; John Thornton makes some enlightening claims in his article on “Slavery and the African Social Structure.”  It is easy for me to view all forms of slavery as a racial issue, which makes it difficult to understand how Africans helped support the slave trade with the Portuguese. Despite the fact that they would sell slaves from other tribes, to subject another human being to such treatment and willingly help perpetuate the practice is difficult to fathom. Thornton claims that the European view of slavery and the African view of slavery differed a great deal. In Africa, much like in the native cultures of South and Latin America slaves were captured enemies, usually the result of war, but in Africa slaves were also the main source of wealth. Individuals could not buy land in the sense that we understand so “their only recourse was to purchase slaves, which as their personal property could be inherited and generate wealth for them.”  It was not a matter of the color of their skin and inferior intellectual or moral abilities but a means to gain wealth and subdue one’s enemies. Although the idea of owning another human being, whatever the reason is a disgusting and humiliating experience, the slave trade started by the Portuguese and practiced in the “New World” was something else&amp;nbsp;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A white Portuguese doctor documented the treatment and suffering of slaves in Africa before they even reached Brazil. He wrote “only the imagination can give an idea of the treatment that the slaves suffer when they are put in those libambo,” which was a chain that bound the slaves. He writes of their horrible treatment, lack of proper nourishment and water, and the fact that their “human nature is entirely overlooked.” However among the slaves he notices “charitable and obliging qualities which are not seen among the backlanders or any other free people. Though ten to twelve thousand may reach the coast, only six to seven thousand are taken to&amp;nbsp;Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite racists overtones the lack of humanity and appalling treatment of the Africans was noted by several prominent white members of the community once the slaves that survived reached Brazil.  One clergyman describes the scene at the slave market at Valongo in Rio de Janeiro. He likens the process to that of a “butcher feeling a calf,” with no other thought the physical capabilities and profit the slave can bring. The slaves were bought and sold with no regard to the fact that these men and women were human beings. Some went to work on plantations, others to be domestic slaves, or trained in some occupation in town, but there were some women who experienced a different fate. Slave prostitutes in Brazil were a common place commodity, even though technically attempts were made to impede the practice. Anything that could be done to demoralize or present the slave as subhuman was done. Slaves were renamed with Christian names upon arrival; women were hired out as wet nurses and subject to the every whim of their master, and human beings were treated as livestock. The wealth Spain gained from their new colonies was built on the backs of the people they conquered and the abhorrent practice of&amp;nbsp;slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The look into slave culture in Africa was incredibly interesting. living in America my view of slavery has generally been Caucasians oppressively and generally violently lording over Africans and African-Americans. the look at how in Africa slaves were the way to prosperity rather than land really busts the view of the vile Europeans and Americans raping of Africa. Africans practiced slavery as a means to progress forward economically. They actively participated in the slave trade and their own inner slave trade. the difference between the African slave trade and the triangle trade was treatment and means. the Triangle Trade allowed Europeans to further their goals on the land they controlled whereas with the African Trade the slaves were the commodity. Europeans treated the slaves like cargo, packed into tight cramped spaces with little food where many died. Africans treated their slaves with care because if one died they would lose wealth and standing, whereas Europeans would just buy a new slave to take the place of the lost labor. the Lane article was interesting in that it discussed how roles of slaves were gendered to man&amp;#8217;s work and &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-corrected&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_0&#34;&gt;woman&amp;#8217;s&lt;/span&gt; such as field work or as a blacksmith&amp;#8217;s apprentice and house work or selling wares in the market. the naming &amp;#8216;ceremony&amp;#8217; was quite interesting where it &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_2&#34;&gt;de&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_3&#34;&gt;africanized&lt;/span&gt; the slaves and attempted to strip them of their past by giving them new names that were vastly foreign to them and forced them into christian context.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7292399274560322422-912475732137457811?l=asfhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The story of Angela Batallas duels as a message of social justice, as well as a parable for political independence. Batallas, a female slave in Quito, beseeched the liberator Bolivar to help grant her freedom from her oppressor and the father of her child. This relationship could be seen to symbolize the connections of the colonizers to the colonized in Latin America during this time period. Angela Batallas also appeared to have a strong sense of self as well as the audacity to speak beyond her station; these qualities are similar to those of the fighting oppressed in colonization. Furthermore, Batallas had the inner will to fight for her freedom, which is the most important parallel of the separate&amp;nbsp;battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colonizers took control of the terrain in which the inhabited, seized the land and over powered the political structures that were already functioning in each region. After the initial phase of infiltration a relationship emerged between the Indians and the Spaniards. These relationships were perfidious, to phrase it mildly, yet the importation of Africans proved to be much harsher. The Spaniards eventually lost connection with the motherland and became Peninsulares. The same can be said for the Africans that found themselves in Latin America, they too transformed from their traditional African nature into a cross cultural society with Christian&amp;nbsp;influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest connection between these two situations can be expressed through the story of Batallas. In the case of the slaves, the connection is clear. Yet the connection with the Independence movement may need further clarifications. The Peninsulares in the parable are represented by Batalles, ironically her oppressors. The Spanish are the slave owners. In the case of slavery, one is being exploited for a service, and in the case of colonization Spain was extracting goods from the colonies with little consideration for the population. In this case the elite became inspired by revolutionary ideals. In the case of Batallas, she received a letter from the liberator but also fought in court for her own&amp;nbsp;freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history465/blog/european-strippers.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div&gt;Everyone is quite familiar with the Atlantic slave trade that helped develop and prosper various European colonies through exploitation and injustice, but few know the diverse and complex history of African civilization that underscore that exploitation and injustice. African civilizations, similar to the indigenous civilizations of Latin America so far examined - Inca and Mexica, promoted ideas, values, and systems contrary to European colonial rule, such as communal land ownership and kinship ties emphasized throughout various spheres in society (including labor). &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, in each empire, conquest through violence was integral to the maintenance of the empire; therefore, to overcome the demands of collective ownership and kinship bonds, African civilizations determined wealth and power through one’s control of human labor, which could then take into account kinship and communal land rights. With this conception of power and wealth, conquest through violence manifested itself through prisoners of war and slaves. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Only after the decimation of the indigenous population did the importation of slave labor begin for labor-intensive crops and activities, such as mining. However, as noted in the Amistad film clip and the readings, the Spaniards stripped the Africans of their previous culture and civilization upon arrival to the New World, as Spaniards had done to the indigenous people when they arrived and confronted the existing populations. The diverse indigenous populations of Latin America became simply and narrowly known collectively as “Indians”’ by the Europeans, while the diverse African population arriving in Latin America was simply and narrowly known collectively as “Black.” Both of these terms fail to recognize previously complex societies from which the designated person came and also diversity within those societies. This phenomena is blatantly demonstrated with the Africans’ renaming upon their arrival before being purchased, being named Christian names or descriptive names in the Spanish language and thereby disregarding the significance of the existing African civilization.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In each case - Inca, Mexica, African, the Spaniards (and by extension, other Europeans) imposed their economic, religious, and political belief systems and further extended these systems’ ideological implications upon the conquered persons in terms of their gender and their labor. For the Africans, this meant similar consequences, though clearly more severely displaced from their traditional way of life, to those for the Incas and the Mexica. In each circumstance, the Spaniards perceived (directly or indirectly) the conquered men as more threatening to Spanish male power than the conquered women; men were also deemed more capable at performing labor-intensive work, as strength is associated with masculinity. For both of these reasons, male African slaves were generally selected for the most labor-intensive or dangerous jobs in agriculture and mining. This same pattern applies to the indigenous men enslaved under Spanish colonization. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Similar patterns also apply to female African slaves and indigenous women, with certain domestic roles designated to them, allowing for greater proximity between enslaved women and the European colonizer. This proximity arguably had several social and economic advantages, but it also carried many clear disadvantages, such as sexual exploitation. (See previous post about the inequality of sexual and marital relations.) &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;These clear and repeated similarities between these diverse groups make sense in the context of their contact with and treatment by European colonizers, in which the Europeans react in the same way to the perceived same “good,” over and over again for their own purposes. &lt;/div&gt;

It was interesting comparing slavery in Latin America to slavery in North America, specifically the South, and finding how similar the two experiences were in two very different places.  Also, the video shown in class depicting the transportation of slaves across the Atlantic was hard to watch.  It is sickening to realize that human beings underwent that much torture and humiliation.  I wondered if those white slave traders had consciences.  Then, I read about the reasons in which they justify these enslavements in order to squash any amount of guilt they may possibly encounter.  The slave traders and buyers (owners), justify slavery by claiming that they are doing a service to them by saving them from the barbarity and tyranny of Africa where they lived as Christ less savages who should feel it a privilege to be captured and be able to live in a world with order and religion.  However, when you look at the way they are treated from capture until their deaths, there is anything but order and Christianity.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;These female slaves were clearly viewed as humans because they were given the important jobs of nursing their master’s children, proving that they realized that these Africans shared the same physical bodies.  It is so contradicting to me as to how they were viewed as sub-human-savages who were beaten or killed for misbehaving and used for the sole purpose of labor and reproduction for profit, yet was perfectly fine to feed their master’s children from their own “African” milk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;It is difficult to fathom how these slave traders and owners cold-heartedly viewed and treated their African slaves, and makes me wonder if they had any guilt for their treatment.  Then, viewing the ways they justified slavery shows me that they did have some (even if very little) guilt because of the ways they justified their acts by claiming to be their saviors from a cruel and savage Africa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4551310302796999455-7105370718523862532?l=laurenhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Learning more and more about the slave-traded system from the past, over the last few weeks, has help me realize how harsh they were treated.  Yes, I have learned that they were beaten and had horrible punishments from learning about it in grade school, but seeing the clip from the video this past week has opened my eyes and, makes me sick to my stomach, of how hard it really was.  The part that got me the most was when they lined up the slaves on the ship and had the bag of rocks and let them sink to the bottom of the ocean, pulling the slaves down with it.  It was a hard realty for them, although it was a bit interesting to learn that some of the slaves from Latin America were allowed the sew their masters for harsh punishment, which I know it was not too common but the fact that they has some rights is surprising, for all the were put through.  One story that I have enjoyed from this weeks readings was Angela Batallas, &lt;em&gt;A Fight for Freedom in Guayaquil.  &lt;/em&gt;There are a few things I enjoyed from this story, and one of them was when Angela was allowed to baptize her baby even thought it was mixed race baby.  It showed that they recognized it as a worthy enough baby to be seen as a product of God.  Another part from the story that I liked was when the Minster believed Angela when she said that her baby’s father was her master.  The Minster could have very easily said I do not believe you and dismissed her and the baby.  It showed that even thought she was a slave; her word did count for something.  One thing that I did find very odd about the story was the fact the many masters would have sexual relations with their slaves even thought many of them had wives and lived in very Christian towns, where cheating on your wife could send you to hell.  The fact that the minister knew that Angela’s master was having sex with her, and he was not punished shows that money was power.  Another thing that is odd about many master having sexual relations with slaves was that fact the their wives had to know something was up but would not say anything to their husbands, just shows you another example that women in the 1800’s were always second class citizens, and men with money always had strong power.  The last thing that I had a hard time understanding about Angela’s story was that even thought he knew that Angela’s child was his, he did not seem to look at him as a son, because his mother was a slave.  It was a hard life for the slaves and its crazy to see how people could be so cruel to one&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt; Naturally I assume that, being educated individuals, we were all previously aware of the horrific and morbid nature and practices that the slave trade/industry consisted of.  But a week of studies such as our previous one is important so that we never forget or undermine the incalculable damage and nightmarish pain that such a destructive practice creates.  However, this week was also important in a revealing sense as well.  I had always pictured the slave trade with the assumption that individuality was deterred and discouraged in slaves by slave traders/owners.  That cultural practices and vital elements of culture such as religion and language were repressed and subsequently halted altogether.  All of this was coupled with the general practice of removing notions of original identity and embedding an entirely new one in the minds of the slaves.  But I was unaware of the extent to which the slave industry had thought out this process and how it was reinforced in all manners of forced labor.&lt;br /&gt;
    Firstly, and sadly, these people were at the time viewed by most in the same light that modern societies view cars.  Slaves were simply thought of as products and not as people.  The system of slave sales had developed to the point that sellers of slaves sold with the same cautiousness warranted by lemon laws.  For instance, if a slave was prone to attempt an escape or was hindered by any kind of handicap the slave trader would disclose this knowledge to potential buyers for their own protection from lawsuits.  I find this, as well as other “industry techniques” quite appalling and disgusting.  The thought that human beings were forced to endure treatments that made them entirely objective and robbed them of personality or humanity is shocking.&lt;br /&gt;
    Many of the labors forced upon slaves reinforce my point that individuality and autonomy of slaves were entirely ignored.  As an example I point to the practice of forced wet nursing among female slaves.  This, to me, ranks among the most horrid tendencies of slave labor for a number of reasons.  Firstly it asserts a level of complete and utter dominance over the slave.  It not only subjects a woman to extremely tender and emotional practice with an infant, but it confirms the thought entirety of a slave belonged to his or her master.  Even their genitals and bodily fluids were viewed as a portion of the owner’s “product.”&lt;br /&gt;
    I reiterate, this process and practice scares me immensely.  If slaveholders truly believed that all facets of their slaves were their own private property then when, if ever, would a line be drawn?  Supposing that a slave holder might actually acknowledge that a slave has a soul, which I believe many might have done given their Christian founded justifications for capturing and buying slaves, then would they consider said soul their property as well?  If so, how could it have come into their possession?  Could these Christians truly contend that a soul was purchased by capital?  If not, how could they have even justified their holding of slaves at&amp;nbsp;all?&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The Thornton article we read this week, &amp;#8220;Slavery and African Social Structure&amp;#8221;, was for me quite fascinating.  My learning up to this point about slavery and slave-holding (what little that was) had up to this point been limited to learning about slavery in the United States.  I guess I always knew that there was some form of slavery in Africa, but beyond that and the idea that it was somehow &amp;#8220;different&amp;#8221;, I didn&amp;#8217;t know&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thornton points out that slavery &amp;#8220;functioned quite differently from the way it functioned in European societies.&amp;#8221;  He gives it&amp;#8217;s origins as economic; with no land held in private hands, labor (other people&amp;#8217;s as well as one&amp;#8217;s own) became the only source of wealth (ultimately, of course, labor is the source of all wealth everywhere under capitalism).  It was different from the slavery practiced by Europeans in that slaves were treated somewhat better and more was invested in them.  I guess with less distance between themselves and their slaves, Africans felt more compelled to treat them somewhat&amp;nbsp;decently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its hard at first to wrap my head around the idea that there were different forms of slavery.  I think part of that comes from a resistance to believing that my ancestors or others of my peers, were part of such an ugly ugly system.  Its easier to think that they were only doing something that might have been done in Africa, not doing something qualitatively worse.  &amp;#8221;If the Africans did it to each other, we&amp;#8217;re no worse than they&amp;nbsp;are.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from a materialist perspective, it makes sense that institutions vary in accordance with the conditions under which they arrive.  A pre-capitalist Africa would develop a different form of slavery than a European society, fresh from conquering a continent, would.  Dr. Black mentioned in class that the development of capitalism as a world system was based in part on the enslavement of black Africans.  Slavery in the Americas intensified the slave trade in Africa, as they both became part of this same system.  Viewed this way, the European involvement in slavery is neither some sickness in European nor is it the same as in Africa.  It was part of a qualitative evolution in the world&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The slave trade seems to affect gender roles in Latin America. This is at least what a cursory look would make one think. The story of slavery goes back to the continent of Africa, but slavery has permeated every society since Biblical times. It is a ridiculous notion that most modern day leftists try to portray Southerners as evil slave owners when so many people have done it before. These slaves were mostly captured by rival tribes trying to gain the upper hand in the region by trading their prisoners of war for superior weaponry. This was nothing more than business for both the Europeans and Africans. On the trip to America, the captured Africans were usually put through grueling conditions that could leave upwards of fifty percent of the slaves dead. The slaves would be brought to the New Word to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Once they were bought, these individuals were used for manual labor in the both the fields and in the house. Here comes the point where the typical pedestrian analyzing the situation would argue that gender roles were socialized on the Africans by the evil&amp;nbsp;Spaniards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “gender roles” one would normally try to categorize are that of manual labor for men and house labor for women. Though this could be argued as forcing gender roles on the general slave public, it is more important to look at why this is so. It all comes down to one reason: biology. Though modern day feminists would try to inculcate people to believe that men and women are equal in every way, they would be wrong. There are specific biological differences. Men have larger muscles while women can bear more pain (this is useful during child birth). The men who were more muscular were put in the fields for intensive labor agriculture; Cotton in the American South while in South America it was cane sugar. The cane sugar would later be turned into rum (this would be the perfect place for a Pirates of the Caribbean reference).  The women were put in the house because they did not have the muscles to do the labor necessary for these crops. One might try to argue the Spanish were trying to force European gender roles onto the slaves, but instead it was more sinister than that. The Europeans were merely making a cold, realist interpretation of the situation to get the most productivity and efficacy of the system. With men working outside and women working inside, then organization could prevail. Men would get the raw materials that would be sent to Europe, enhancing the economic situation of the owners, while the women would take care of them. There was no “gender socialization” going on. Rather, the Europeans needed work to be done and used the appropriate people for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Slavery has been around for centuries in many different forms in many different areas of the world. Slaves were generally captured soldiers during war or even a religious group of people or race minority in an area. Slaves were often used for construction of big structures or cultivation of the land. Around the 1400&amp;#8242;s, Europeans were very active in Africa rounding up slaves for their colonies and with the help of many African tribes many Africans were rounded up by the hundreds of thousands. The Atlantic Slave Trade was a big enterprise used by several countries like Britain, Portugal, France and Spain and many others to turn out profits for goods that were scarce in the Old World. When the New World was discovered slaves were taken from Africa to South America on huge slave ships were tons of slaves were kept. Conditions on these boats were horrible and just barely livable enough for a majority of the slaves to survive the journey. Once on the other side they were taken to a port town where the slaves were auctioned off to Plantation owners or small business owners in towns. Slaves were treated like property more than human beings and they were exchanged in this way. Even though many were given christian names when they arrived there were given little rights. Some did make money by taking the skills they had learned from their masters and using them to make a living once they were freed, but that rarely happened. Men and women had different tasks depending on the location and their condition. Slave men in urban areas worked with their masters if they owned a small business. For example, some were apprentices to their masters who worked as a blacksmith. Women in urban areas often worked at the homes of the masters that bought them, helping with the house work and helping with the kids of the house.  Slaves in rural areas had a different lifestyle and it was once again divided by sex. Men often worked in the fields doing the harder labor, harvesting and chopping wood while the women worked in the houses or even planted in the fields. Every now and then slaves would escape or revolt and those lucky enough got away but those that didn&amp;#8217;t were punished severely and sometimes put to death and many of the up rises ended in bloodshed. But those slaves that did make it out would head to nearby free slave camps or just somewhere far away from their masters. Slavery was huge in the New World from around this time all the way until the Civil War in America during the end of the 1800&amp;#8242;s but it still remains in some countries today and it&amp;#8217;s really sad that countries still use people like&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;It was very interesting this week learning more about the African slave trade from a global perspective. Here in America information about the slave trade is usually examined in the context of the emergence of slavery in the United States, and it was enlightening to take a look at it from the perspective of another region, namely Latin America. Specifically in the realm of gender roles, the articles we read and discussed in class really helped trace the role this Triangular trade system of the Portuguese had on gender roles both in Latin America and in&amp;nbsp;Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed the Kris Lane article mainly in class, and for good reason, as it is excellent at demonstrating how the roles African slaves were placed in determined their concept of gender. I was surprised at just how different the roles of slaves were depending both on their sex and on their location (urban, rural, etc.). There were slaves fulfilling the stereotypical &amp;#8220;field worker&amp;#8221; portrayal that has come to be linked with African slaves at this time, but there were also slaves involved in urban life, fulfilling the daily tasks that their elite masters did not feel like doing. Women were automatically placed into roles that the Spanish felt were feminine, and males were placed into what the Spanish perceived as masculine roles. The effect this had on forming gender roles cannot be underestimated. Whereas we discussed the possibility of Andean indigenous women preserving their pre-Spanish culture through their new roles, it&amp;#8217;s hard the imagine African women could in any way preserve their former way of life. Furthermore, by forcing their way of life upon them, the Spanish justified themselves through religion. As Lane says, &amp;#8220;it was the Africans&amp;#8217; &lt;em&gt;privilege&lt;/em&gt; to be captured.&amp;#8221; By capturing them and giving them Christian names, they were apparently saving them. The amount of times in world history religion has been used for non-religious goals is too many to count, but add another one to the&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found most interesting this past week, though, was the information that the African cultures were already built upon slavery, pre-arrival of the Portuguese. Often we get the impression that African slaves were captured by white men marching into Africa and doing the deed themselves. While there probably were instances of that, the vast majority of the slaves were apprehended by other Africans, because slavery was natural in their society. What is key, however, is that the way slaves were treated in Africa differed greatly than how they were treated in Latin America. So while slavery wasn&amp;#8217;t a new concept to Africans making the Middle Passage, it was a new level of harshness and coercion. Would the slave trade have been nearly as successful had the system of slavery not already existed in Africa? I doubt it, as a large part of the efficiency of the triangle trade system was that the Portuguese were able to exploit an already existent practice to their&amp;nbsp;benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;This week discussion was rather interesting. We discussed the different slave trades and how they were different. In today&amp;#8217;s society, the views on slave is manly focus on the new settlers of the new world in America who came to African to get slaves to help maintain the Settlers farms in which helped the Settlers flourish financial. Also we discussed how the process of getting slaves from Africa to America was violent and deemed immoral. To explain this process, we were seen a clip of the movie &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_0&#34;&gt;Amistad&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In this clip, the slaves were forced to leave there homeland and were treated horrific matters. They were beat and some died due to the harsh conditions that they had to endure on the boat. They were beat to put fear into them so that they would not think about going against their master or the people that had capture them. They were also made to travel in cramp and damp quarters and were literally on top of one another. Due to these harsh conditions, disease ran rapidly and killed off many Africa slaves during the trip to America. Also in the clip, the slaves were given new American names so to speak  in which this process was to strip away their identity from being from Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that was discuss was the fact that Africans were selling their own people to the American people to earn money and for own selfish reasons and also had slaves as well. However, Africans treated their slaves slightly better because to in their eyes, the slaves were precious cargo but the Americas just felt that if they lost a slave that they could just buy another one. In &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-corrected&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_1&#34;&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-corrected&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_2&#34;&gt;Latin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-corrected&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_3&#34;&gt;American&lt;/span&gt; slaves had rights and could sued their masters for mistreatment. These different elements show that there were different structures , rules, and regulations depending on who was doing the selling of slaves and who were being the owner of slaves as well .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also within the slave system, different slaves had different roles depending on your gender. African male slaves usually did the hard labor while the African females slaves did field work as well but could also be use to do house work .&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/811234197297643948-8638130996492013528?l=ras2011.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;For this post, I feel like relying mostly on Thorton&amp;#8217;s article because I learned so much while reading it. I know we&amp;#8217;ve all heard that slavery has been around in all cultures, not just America, but this article really developed upon this and explained that yes, it&amp;#8217;s true, slavery was in Africa and has always been around, but it was expressed differently when the Europeans arrived&amp;#8211;this was the&amp;nbsp;kicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our group discussions in class this past week, my group talked mostly about how slaves in Africa were used primarily as a source of investment or wealth. Before the slave trade by the Portuguese began, private ownership was  basically nonexistent to African society, just as it was among the Incas. I believe the kings sort of owned the land, and people lived and worked among it, so owning a slave was more of an investment, and these slaves were treated as&amp;nbsp;such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s almost becoming thematic in this class that private ownership of land has been the cause for so much shift in society, and more specifically, gender relations. This has been the same when discussing African societies. Clearly, slavery has been around, but when the Portuguese instituted a different definition of ownership (private land), we begin to see the slavery that took the dominant form here in America, one of severe punishment and coercion of African Americans. Our group also really talked about how this slave trade significantly affected the gender roles and culture at large among the Africans, as it did to the Indigenous, as well. Thornton really expresses how as many African males entered the slave trade, the &amp;#8220;sexual division of labor&amp;#8221; was extremely affected. What really struck me, though, was not only including those women who were left behind but those that did enter the slave trade, and how their identities seemed even more unimportant to the Europeans than the male slaves. I know that not much status was at stake just by mere fact of being a slave in general, but as our group mentioned, many written records of slaves by the Portuguese left women unnamed, or simply just referred to them as slave women or girls. I really believe that this just speaks to the larger context of how Europeans at this time did not acknowledge women in political and economical realms even among their own. I&amp;#8217;m anxious to learn this next week about European gender relations, so I&amp;#8217;ll have a better grasp of&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also find it really interesting how, as even seen in the Amistad clip, the Europeans were renaming the slaves as they got off ship. These names really reflected the Christian values of the Europeans and basically stripped the slaves of their previous heritage and identity. I just find it really odd that this could possibly have been done in a &amp;#8220;Christain&amp;#8221; sense. These Europeans were renaming the slaves that were brutally treated, and somehow miraculously survived the Middle Passage, with Christian names! Did they really believe that this was &amp;#8220;Christian&amp;#8221;?!? I guess people have used the Bible to justify some rather horrible events throughout all of history. Sort of makes me wonder what they&amp;#8217;ll say about our generation one&amp;nbsp;day&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title type="html">Gender Ambiguity and the Mexica</title>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The thoughts that the Aztecs, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;AKA&lt;/span&gt; the Mexica, normally evoke from my mind are those of war and attributes significant of the male gender.  It never occurred to me, however, that these ideals would apply to women as well.  War as a central ideology pervaded almost every aspect of their culture and daily lives.  One would have to wonder how the status of women was affected in this war-driven&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reading the excerpt from Rosemary Joyce, I gleaned a sense of ambiguity surrounding the analysis of gender in the Meseoamerican society.  From the facts discussed in class, it seems very clear that certain tasks were assigned to each sex such as women sweeping the hearth.  All of these tasks, of course, in some way were significant of elements of war.  So, I found this piece to be particularly confusing in what Joyce was trying to address because from my point of view, these people had separate duties and a clearly delineated sense of&amp;nbsp;self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, there are a few points that I will concede to support Joyce in her general confusion.  We did discuss in class the presence of male gods, female gods, and a third gender of gods.  So it seems that the dichotomy of sex was not a prevailing theory for these people.  To further this statement, Joyce acknowledged points of &amp;#8220;severe ambiguity&amp;#8221; such as images where secondary sex characteristics are absent and the discovery of women&amp;#8217;s tools where they expected to find a man&amp;#8217;s (5).  Joyce also made a valid point when she argued that the fixed distinction of sex is intrinsic of the modern western tradition and may not have applied to other&amp;nbsp;societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe I can see what the debate is about then.  How can we clearly understand the nature of this society&amp;#8217;s culture and their gender roles if we cannot even discern what genders they delineated within their communities?  We cannot project our own values of gender onto this ancient society lest we find artifacts of a woman where we expected to find that of a man.  I suppose we&amp;#8217;d have to clear our head of our prior assumptions of what can and cannot occur as far as ideologies in ancient societies.  The struggle then lies in how to analyze the apparent power struggle between men and women in the context of the Mexica if they didn&amp;#8217;t believe in the existence of only a man and a woman.  Was there a struggle at all?  Were women viewed as lesser beings?  Or were they just allowed different tasks than whatever other genders existed at the time.  It would be difficult for me to comprehend the Mexica men, living in a society so driven by violence and other testosterone-riddled affairs, not placing women in a position of submission.  But I suppose we cannot know for certain with regards to this Mesoamerican&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;I thought that one of the most interesting characters in the primary source we read this week was the old woman who congratulates the mother on her sons having turned out well.  In her lifetime, this old woman has witnessed the fall of the indigenous order under which she grew up, the arrival of the Spanish, and the consolidation of Spanish rule over the Mexica people.  While she would have most likely been brought up in the Mexica tradition, worshiping the Mexica panoply of gods, she now speaks the rhetoric of the Catholic church just like the other Nahuatl speakers seen in this text.  It would seem that the Catholic worldview has been syncretically absorbed by her, and made to fit the world around her.  Yet, despite this seeming adoption of Spanish values, her reminiscences of the past are fondly nostalgic and her view of the present and future is exceedingly grim.  In congratulating the mother on raising such fine sons, she expresses the fact that very few people grow up anymore, they just die off.  This is perhaps an allusion to the wave of disease brought by the Spanish, or perhaps it refers to the hard life led by indigenous people, particularly males it would seem from the Burkett article, in the wake of Spanish contact.  She describes the splendor of the Mexica nobility, contrasted with the way everything now seems to be coming to an end.  She invokes the idea of the Lord&amp;#8217;s wrath in this apocalyptic world view, implying that He is punishing the Mexica for some offense they have done Him.  I think it is interesting that even though it is the Spanish themselves responsible for the destruction, she sees it in terms of their own religious view which she has adopted.  She takes the idea of the vengeful God and applies to what she is experiencing in her own&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout her monologue, one can trace many contradictions that are probably fairly representative of the condition faced by indigenous Mexicans during this time.  She refers to the indigenous gods as &amp;#8220;demons&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;false,&amp;#8221; describing that period as a &amp;#8220;time of darkness,&amp;#8221; yet her recollection of pre-contact life seems imbued with a sense of order, whereas her life now is overcast by doom.  This brings up an important question about the nature of indigenous adoption of the Catholic faith: did people like this old woman truly adapt the Catholic vision to their own lives, or were they merely trying to stay out of trouble with the new order?  Did adoption of these new religions allow for the old traditions to be kept alive by merely changing the names of the idols?  Or, did the nobles of Tetzcoco who penned this document over-emphasize the Christian influence as their own means of pleasing the new order?  These are important things to think about when examining the first-hand documents of the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;Congratulations to a Married Couple&amp;#8221; written by Tetzcoco nobles shows both the influence of the Spanish and the heritage of the Nahua people. The intent was to standardize the expectations of people who considered themselves nobility. Part of this process involved the idealization of traditional pagan systems, but these were now combined with the value system of the Franciscan monks and the Spanish nobles who were beginning to influence the Nahua. Both the native and Spanish nobility felt that they were united by class similarities, so they were willing to modify elements of their cultures so that they could form mutually beneficial relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recurring element in the text is references to the God of the Catholic Spanish, as well as the Holy Mother and the sacraments. Though the Nahua had their own deities prior to the arrival of the Spanish, they were largely able to adapt their own systems of worship to the Catholic system in order to please the Franciscan monks and conquistadors. This made religion another unifying factor for the nobles, and this dialogue uses such imagery in order to emphasize the uniformity of the blended society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groom is encouraged to work on the provisions needed in the household and to constantly be alert to the needs of those around him. Even as he sleeps he is charged with protecting his family at all costs and ensuring their happiness. This responsibility is similar to the traditional roles of Nahua men. Going to war to gain worth and glory was the way they supported their families and their standing in the community. Even though the Spanish discouraged war and many of the blood sacrifices that followed the capture of prisoners, the Nahua retained the symbolic nature of their gender roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bride&amp;#8217;s advice is to work tirelessly in the home to keep it clean and hospitable for her family and community. She is also responsible for the food and drink that anyone in the household needs, as well as the duties of spinning and weaving. These had been women&amp;#8217;s responsibilities throughout Nahua history, and while the Spanish usually thought of these jobs as acts of servitude performed by women as weaker creatures, the natives saw them as a way for women to wage their own war against chaos and evil spirits. So the translation of a similar worldview was not always based on the same motivations, but allowed the two cultures to merge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important thing to keep in mind about these dialogues is that they were a guideline for a new noble culture. Those who wrote them were hoping to unite the Spanish and Nahua nobility to increase their own power and avoid serious conflict with the newcomers. This does not mean, however, that all of the natives agreed with these new principles. They were merely an ideal guideline for interactions based on the ancient structures of Nahua society and the traditional ideals of the colonizing Spanish. But they do show how the colonial society developed in ancient Mexican cultures and the effect the changes had on the native peoples.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-7384146998515219339?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I chose to analyze a document called &amp;#8220;Testament of María (Culhuacan, 1580)&amp;#8221;. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Origins: This document was written on Thursday August 25th, 1580 in colonial Mexico. It is a testament of a woman named Nahua woman named María, but it was actually written by a notary named Juan (de San) Pedro. The document was meant to be read by her family (close relatives - as it says in the actual testament). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Motives: María is an invalid woman who is leaving instructions for her relatives on what to do with her property upon her death. She makes it clear that she is not a wealthy woman and has no goods to hand out to her family. The only thing she really has is her house. She wants her house to be sold, rather than leaving it to someone in her family. Her reason for doing so is to repay her debts with the money from the house. If there is any money left after the debts are paid off, she requests that the money be used to say masses for her. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Perspective: When documents are dictated to others to be written down, we always have to wonder if we can completely rely on the source. In this case, the person in question is the notary (who actually transcribed the document). However, since other names are listed at the end of the document as being witnesses, then we can probably rely on this document as being accurate. Concerning María, we see that she lived a simple life and did not possess a lot of wealth. And because she is instructing her family to use the profit from selling her house to pay off her debts, rather than just splitting the money amongst the relatives, this suggests something about her character. She is being honest about the money that she owes people, and she is being loyal to her fellow community members. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Text: The topic of this document is simple and because María did not possess a lot of goods to hand out to her relatives, the text is very short. The text also shows a diligence in record-keeping due to the list of names at the end of the document. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Information: This document shows that the Mesoamericans of the 16th century were engaging in record-keeping. They also understood the importance of a notary to make documents official. We are also told that María was married twice, so this shows that women were not always left as widows if something happened to their first husband. The religious aspect of colonial Mexico is also evident in this document. In the beginning of the testament, we find the phrase &amp;#8220;for God our Lord&amp;#8221; and near the end of the testament, she requests that if there is any money left after selling her house, &amp;#8220;let them say masses for me&amp;#8221;.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After analyzing the text using this method, I found that I was able to better understand the document and the reasons for its existence.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4101372912891888807-8579393542993404304?l=alegria-tristeza-history465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;In the primary source given, Nahuatl Speeches and Dialogues, exemplary behavior is outlined, in the form of examples of different situations, and how one should speak in each of them. This signifies that the stratification of society was somewhat open, due to the notion that all should speak similarly, yet the actualization of this is not likely. This text was written by a noble; although the thought was overreaching the general idea was that all in society should speak in this manner. The classes were at the very least meant to appear to all be well spoken and revere God in all that they did. The influence of Christianity is overwhelming in this document. However, it is very important to note that these speeches were idealized notions of how one is to behave, rather than actual representations of their behavior, which could have been very&amp;nbsp;different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one situation the policy prescribed for greeting a family member on the way to market was a lengthy conversation about the health of family and God and his desire to grant health or afflictions. The representation of such notions equate to a desire for the general population to engage in healthy dialog, yet it is lacking one age old aspect of grocery store chat—gossip. This seems to be completely left out of the conversation, and although this period is far separated from modern forms of communication, it is sure that gossip had its place in society and generally this type of encounter is where that would take place. Especially in this situation, because it is said that they lived very far apart and this would be prime opportunity for local news to&amp;nbsp;travel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idealized notion of conversation in this text also is “reflective of a bygone era” which reveals that the practicality of this means of communication is also off skew. In many examples the turn of phrase revolves around the notion of health and well being, yet little mention is of how to respond if one is feeling ill. It is not possible that one feels blessed in health each day, yet there is no explanation for this. This could be similar to the greeting of many modern Americans where when someone asks another “How are you today?” the proper reply is always “Fine, thank you. How are you?” This could be similar, yet in many cases the questions are to immediate family such as mothers or uncles. In reality it is unlikely that one would hide their true status of well being form this segment of the population, thus the notions may be over&amp;nbsp;done.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular source is quite interesting and important because the idealized values and means of communication are still very important. They reveal the desires of the population or at the very least the noble in this case of the population. The shortcomings of the document are obvious in the sense that they lack the actualization of conversation, yet the examples provide a glimpse into the societal expectations of the period, rather than the true portrayal of society. This is their society at its&amp;nbsp;best. &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;For my posting this week I will be discussing the concept and theme of war in the culture of Mesoamerica, particularly how the warrior motif related to gender as a whole in the region.  I took great interest and was attentive in taking note that in early Mesoamerican societies women were generally viewed as “warriors of the household,” rather than simple keepers of the home or servants of their husband or patriarch.  This distinguished war based view of a woman’s role in life was vital and extremely ceremonious.  This began upon the birth of a woman, immediately after the completion of the birth her placenta was cut and buried under the hearth.  This was representative of where she would be “battling” throughout life.  The birth itself was even considered a form of warfare.  Should the mother successfully deliver the child, she was considered victorious in her battle against the cosmos.  These battles were of an extensive series.  For instance, keeping the home tidy and clean was not simply a daily task that a woman was obligated to perform, rather it was viewed as a part of her ongoing battle against chaos and disorder.  I also found it interesting that in order to reinforce the notion that women must be prepared to “fight for their home,” they were given toy brooms and household appliances to play with in their infancy.  Naturally the warrior motif was by no means exclusive to the females of societies, the men were also taught from birth that their primary roles were to be warriors above all else.  Similarly to women, shortly following the birth of a male child their placenta was symbolically buried in the fields.  This was done as a representation of their coming battles both of physical labor as well as the battles that they would fight with warring peoples.  Their upbringing also showed an unsurprising parallelism with that of women in that in infancy boys were given toy shields and weapons to which they were to become accustomed.    I find this intertwined relationship of warfare and life in early Mesoamerica very intriguing.  It seems that it was necessitated by multiple reasons.  One which seems apparent to me is the desire, or rather need for purpose in life.  Perhaps it was easier for people to confidently live their lives, even for societies to function when they were given a direct and straightforward purpose from birth.  It is clearly a much simpler system in terms of organizing a civilization and identifying roles for its people.  Rather than people going through the gradual process of finding roles or purposes for themselves, they were raised for specific purposes from birth.  But I have little doubt that this poorly received by people.  From what I can gather this system would, at least on some level, have a foundation of pride.  Given the importance that was placed on being successful in battle, it seems logical to assume that masterful performance in all facets of warfare was highly regarded and endlessly pursued by Mesoamerican&amp;nbsp;peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Though the Nahuatl writings found transcribed in volume five of the Florentine Codex is viewed as a primary source based on when it was written and who was credited as the narrator, I feel that it should also be viewed as a secondary source; or at the very least a skewed and biased primary source. From the onset, the reader is told that this collection of moral narratives were written down by nobles and translated by Fray Bernardino de Sahagun. What does this mean? Simply, this accounting was written by the upper echelon of the remaining conquered Aztecs and further translated by a Spanish missionary, whose own culture and predisposition influenced how the material was written down. Women were not taught to read or write by the conquering Spaniards, rather, they were relegated to the role of mother, maid and inamorata. The selections we read ranged from marriage blessings to manners and childbirth. The advice to the male was simple; work hard, stay sober, and procreate to ensure their lineage. The advice to females was to wait for your parents to marry you off, procreate, have and raise children while tending to the home, and to anticipate death at any of these stages. I also felt that a “blessed” married woman would have male offspring if she and her husband were obedient to God. I also noticed numerous references to life that were precluded their colonization by the Spanish. In the vague conversation between the grandmother and her daughter and grandsons, the conversation alludes to former aspects of their native customs. In the line, “that you took from your secret cases and chests, the precious feathers and plumes…” the author is talking about former symbols of noble birth and lineage that had to be hidden once their people had been conquered. A few paragraphs later the grandmother talks of how many relatives their family and community once had and then questions their deaths; &lt;br /&gt;“But now everywhere our Lord is destroying and reducing the land, we are coming to an end and disappearing. Why? For what reason?” &lt;br /&gt;This seems to directly relate the deaths of the natives, from warfare and disease, at the hands of the Spanish Christians. It is curious that Sahagun printed this statement considering the implications that would accompany it. The next references she makes are with regards to the native’s former pagan and uncivilized ways. She asserts that they too were raised in temples and yet, someone, either the narrator or the translator, chose to refer to these as “demon temples”, thus making a further reference to the carvings and statues outside the temple; which were obviously that of as demonic by the missionary. &lt;br /&gt;There was also great pride taken in describing the “education” of the male children, while the females received only a few sentences, describing their lessons in housekeeping. The older female goes on to describe the downfall of her people of their civilization through adulterous females and their sexual escapades. This seems closer to Christian references to the Garden of Eden, and the fall of Babylon and Sodom and Gomorrah rather than actions the native population would have taken given the similarities to the defiling of virgins. Once again it also obscurely places blame on females for the ruin of lives, both past and present. &lt;br /&gt;Though Sahagun should be praised for his collection, even if he did only use male perspectives on his narratives, caution should be noted to the reader for the amount of sexism and bigotry was also penned within the volumes of the Florentine Codex.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-3628897456419911469?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div&gt;In considering parallel social structures within a culture, many people often assume parallelism necessitates equal social relations, but one does not automatically imply the other by any means, as Kellogg (125, 132) and Burkhart state in their analyses of Mexica society. Both scholars discuss the complementary roles of men and women, with distinctly separately sphere assigned to each, but both Kellogg and Burkhart’s analyses highlight (intentionally or not) men’s higher social position through their direct connection to and therefore glorification through warfare as opposed to women’s indirect connection to warfare, such as supporting the warrior, generally viewed as in connection to the man. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Further, negative qualities in Mexica society are designated feminine traits, more likely to be exhibited by a woman, such as cowardice (Kellogg 132) and immorality (Burkhart 28). This conception of immorality as “associated with a failure to stay home” (Burkhart 28) either is the cause of justification for women’s extremely restricted existences in Mexica society, confined largely to the home to keep domestic order but permitted to further their spiritual education. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;As in our society, naturalization began at birth with very specific gender rituals performed by the midwife (Burkhart 45/ Nahuatl speech), continued until death (Burkhart 45), and invaded every person’s every moment of existence, such as through occupational expectations, relational expectations (particularly in marriage), wardrobe, etc. The midwife’s speech from Book &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;VI&lt;/span&gt;, particularly the Thirty-first Chapter, of the Florentine Codex (Nahuatl speech) emphasizes this immediate, penetrating naturalization at birth.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The Florentine Codex (named for its current holding place) is an accumulation of written and pictorial records from about 1540 to 1585 (the prehispanic era) in this region, documenting conversations and interviews with indigenous people. This demonstrates the Mexica’s desire to keep a historical record of their way of life, their rituals and practices. The aforementioned chapter records a representative ritual performed by a midwife at a birth, both of a male and of a female. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;But why? To preserve the history of their civilization, as countless other civilizations have done before them - simply to remember their way of life, specifically this custom at birth. To legitimize their way of life - with established traditions, described formally in writing and in glyphs, these beliefs and practices are less easily challenged by those belonging to the society or outsiders due to the seemingly long-standing, entrenched quality of the way of life à and thereby perpetuate the practice. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;While it is unclear who the author of the additional portions of the codex is and why he or she felt it necessary to make the additions included with the midwife’s direct quotations, the midwife herself (as did the anonymous author) devoted greater attention and energy to discussing the male’s entrance to the world and what awaited him than that of the female. Further, the discussion of the male, while more extensive, was also more glorified: the midwife compares the male to an assortment of strong, noble, fierce animals; the midwife emphasizes the male’s ability to move and grow with little attachment to the domestic sphere but rather the male’s purpose’s for war; lastly, the midwife declares the male’s potential for renown and eternal glory through warfare. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;On the other hand, the midwife primarily associates weariness, anguish, and fatigue with the realm of the female, a realm limited strictly to the home. The midwife declares that the female will grow tired, specifically using the phrases drudge and sweat in describing her expected duties. There is no glorification in the life of a woman. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;While the parallelism in this ritual is certainly evident, equality is not. It seems to me that equality was not really of any concern - to men or to women; the society functioned in an orderly, efficient fashion as it was established, and people generally respected the nature of things. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The most glaring example of this - parallelism without equality - is demonstrated through Mexica marriage ritual and practice, in contrast to the Andean tradition, particularly in consideration of women‘s relative position in society and in the household; however, I have not the time to go into this now (but I hope you are interested - if so, ask/comment) - see Anderson 60-61, 70, 85. &lt;/div&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;What has become known as the Florentine Codex is a history of the Nahuat speaking people, written down by a Franciscan, Fray Bernardino de Sahagun. He began his work around the 1540s by gathering speeches and interviews from the various members of the society, and was written in Nahuatl. Sahagun’s purpose in completing such as arduous task has been explained by his desire to “extirpate idolatry” and preserve the traditions and language of the Mexican Indian culture. Although the Spanish had come to Mesoamerica, the culture had yet to be greatly affected by the notions of Christianity and European society, so what Sahagun recorded is mostly the life of the Mexica Indians pre- Spanish conquest.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excerpts from the midwife’s speeches in Book &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;VI&lt;/span&gt; have proven to be extremely enlightening in ascertaining the gender roles both males and females were expected to perform. I believe it gives a startlingly clear picture of how that society saw and defined gender. While giving birth, the mother, if she was a noble woman, was attended to by possibly two to three midwives who bathed the mother and cleaned the house. Once the baby was born the midwife “shouted; she gave war cries, which meant the woman had fought a good battle, had become a brave warrior.” This image reinforces the warrior motif so prevalent in that society. Everything, even the smallest gesture or chore could be given meaning relating to some kind of battle. The women, though confined to certain roles were considered warriors within their sphere, battling evil and taking captives in their own way. The gender parallelism that defined Mexica culture can be described in terms of&amp;nbsp;warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after birth, the child whether male or female was placed into their clearly distinctive and defined roles. The midwife, even as she is cutting off the umbilical cord gives a speech to the child explaining their fate and duty. The male would die either in sacrifice to the gods or in battle, and his umbilical cord was entrusted to the warriors to be buried field “where warfare was practiced.” The female’s umbilical cord was buried by the hearth, to signify that she would remain at home and not wonder off. The male’s destiny lay in battle, where he would perform his duty to the sun, and the girl’s heart was to remain at home, fighting her battles with a broom and a&amp;nbsp;loom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While women were expected to remain at home and perform typical “women’s work,” I believe it is more about how society perceived the work. It is clear by the midwife’s speech that neither the male nor the female was considered more important than the other, and that the female by staying home was not in any way inferior. She was a brave warrior, as evident by the midwife’s cry of victory after a birth. Women did not stay at home because they were believed to be incapable of anything else, they remained at home to perform the necessary duties that ensured the survival of their community and the safety of their&amp;nbsp;husbands.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Even just glancing through the speeches, anyone would notice how important religion is to these nobles. It is clear that the Spanish have had a significant effect on the Nahuatl with almost every other word being some sort of reference or thankful statement to God. Probably because I am not accustomed to this sort of reverence in writing today, the writings seemed overly emphasized with references to God and His blessings. I think we all can agree that these primary sources highlight the religious fervor in Nahuatl society, but as the introduction mentioned, these writings are&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;idealized.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read through some of the speeches that focused on child behavior and what was to be expected of them. These noble writers seemed to promote that the children of the newer generations were not as respectful and prone to &amp;#8220;misdeeds&amp;#8221; than children of previous times. I was sort of laughing to myself a little after reading this, because I would like to think that my own grandparents would probably write about how times have changed the current generation as well. But back to the topic&amp;#8230;.looking at these primary sources with a more focused perspective, I believe that we as readers can also see just how roles were divided and what was expected behavior towards others. Although idealized, the nobles write in a respectful manner with every greeting started with a courteous remark in a religious&amp;nbsp;fashion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked the speech about children and what was expected of them, as I mentioned earlier. I found it especially interesting in the speech the older man gave about a boy&amp;#8217;s roles being that one should rise early and work. The work ethic of the Nahuatl is really emphasized even at very young ages. Idleness is not revered, and people seemed to always have chores, although separate for boys and girls, that were important to the community as a&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The values are definitely clear: hard work and religion are central, or atleast an idealized level to try and achieve for the Nahuatl. Shifting gears a little, though, I couldn&amp;#8217;t ignore the final source: the murder entry. Of course, the murder of the wife was written as justifiable because she had committed adultery. There was no sense of remorse for this act by the husband, indicating how adultery was probably more &amp;#8220;sinful&amp;#8221; than even murder. I wish there was an entry of a woman dealing with a husband who had committed adultery to compare to see what differences between women and men&amp;#8217;s roles in a marriage consisted of. Maybe adultery was only discussed in terms of the wife&amp;#8230;.however, this speech really expressed how adultery was looked down&amp;nbsp;upon.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history465/blog/mexica-order-and-dialogues.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;It is clear that the Mexica value an ordered society. This is clear not only from their beliefs concerning the perpetuation of the state, but between interactions with each other. In Nahuatl Speeches and Dialogues one can see how the culture tries to create stability and hierarchy for the people. This document was written by nobles in the Tetzcoco valley, which means it is immediately suspect to the anti-elitists who think they would just use this document to try and oppress the poor. However, what is more important is that the nobles tried to create an ordered society of greetings and salutations. When a specific type of person responds to another specific type of person then they are to say certain things. For example, there are dialogues for everything from a female seeing her relatives to two noble boys greeting their grandmother to advice for eating with good breeding. This advice is almost organic in nature because it affects so many parts of people’s&amp;nbsp;lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors in doing this were clearly trying to create order in society, as previously said. If there are pre-prescribed answers and formalities to everyday events, then everyone knows what to say and do. This is important for a society based on a cosmology where they are constantly waging war against chaos. A structured response will allow order to be imposed on what could habe been perceived as disorder among people. People’s interactions are chaotic, but by writing this order will prevail in the contest between the two&amp;nbsp;sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the document, one can also determine that this is post Catholic interactions with the indigenous peoples of Meso-America. The reader can see this because of the constant reference to “Our Lord,” and the fact there are described interactions between people and priests and friars. It is difficult to quantify how much this affects the document. The Catholic Church, and especially European Catholics, preferred and loved an ordered society. However, the Mexica also loved an ordered society. This convergence of the two civilizations could have to create the need for this document because of how much the two preferred regulation to&amp;nbsp;chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most important concerning the Nuahtl dialogues is that who read it can now see the importance and need for order in a collectivist society. Where the individual must be subverted for the people as a whole, it is only logical that even an individual’s responses to conversation could be subverted for order of society. Every part of these people’s lives was made to fit in certain responses and actions, which is an alien concept for modern Americans who believe the individual is sacrosanct. It appears that no part of the Mexica society granted such privacy to not be affected by the need for&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I decided to examine the &amp;#8220;Nahuatl-language testament of Maria&amp;#8221;. The &lt;strong&gt;origin&lt;/strong&gt; of this document is the city-state of Culhuacan, which was a Nahuatl-speaking pre-Columbian city-state in the Valley of Mexico. As the title suggest, it is a testament by a woman named Maria. It was given Thursday the 15th of August in the year 1580. It was made before a group of witnesses, but the tone seems to indicate it was a public affair, meant for anyone who so desired access to it, and specifically directed to God in several&amp;nbsp;sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;motives&lt;/strong&gt; of the article are definitely to give a testament about the selling of her house, and the debts of her and her two previous husbands outstanding. There seems to be great concern with paying off those debts, both for honors sake and for spiritual implications. It almost seems like a will, a document written for the purpose of record keeping so that things are carried out just as Maria wishes them to be. &amp;#8220;Let no know violate my testament&amp;#8221; describes the importance placed upon it being carried&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;perspective &lt;/strong&gt;of this woman Maria is shown through her honest confession of debts outstanding. Obviously it is important for her to pay them off, despite perhaps being in the latter years of her life. She even asks her stepchild to take care of her and her husbands&amp;#8217; debts. It was likely very important both in the spiritual realm and in the social one to stick to your word, and to take care of any debts that you may&amp;nbsp;owe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;text&lt;/strong&gt; itself doesn&amp;#8217;t really try to argue anything, it is simply a legal document stating Maria&amp;#8217;s wishes. I compared it to a will earlier, and it is similar in the fact that there is a strong urgency for the wishes expressed in it to be carried out as she wants them to be. It gives some insight into the legal systems of the Valley of Mexico at this time, and also insight into the social values and the importance of paying off debts. One common thread throughout is the focus on God, and the fact that she is a sinner and needs saving. This might either be a reflection of the spiritual traditions of the culture, or evidence of the effect the Franciscan missionaries were having in the&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;information&lt;/strong&gt; given by this text has already been discussed somewhat above. I conclude by observing that this text gives insight into the daily life of the Valley of Mexico, and evidence of social values. Obviously a legal system was in place, and there was a high emphasis on being in good standing with others. I am not sure whether this is solely due to spiritual implications of being dishonest, but nonetheless it is important. There might also be evidence of the impact of missionaries, though that can not be concluded just from the scope of this&amp;nbsp;text.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:medium;&#34;&gt;Going over a few of the Nahuatla speeches and dialogues, and the class lechers, has given me some in site of how men and women in Mesoamerican society lived. Reading the sixth dialogue speech called Grant of a house site in the Nahua Tetzcoco has helped me understand the hospitable nature they can have. This is shown when Ana’s older brother Juan Miguel lets her family live in this house for a month. They also are very grateful for him letting them live with in his house. Ana also seem to have an understanding that having her family live with him can be some what of a burden, and asked for a piece of land so they could build a hut for her family. This is nice but to me seems some what unfair because they have the same father, Saint San Miguel, but she dose not own any part of the land, and only her older brother owns it. It tells me that in the Mesoamerican society the fathers passed on the land to the sons and not the daughters. Which I am assuming that the sons inherit everything and the daughters married a man and got her wealth from him. Another thing that I have learned about the Mesoamerican society is that they must have elders permission to get large tasks done. This is shown when Juan Miguel has to ask other men if he could allow him to give up some of his land to give to his younger sister and her family. It tells me that they land owners never had complete control of their own land and the elders must approve many things. One last thing I have learned from the “Grant of a House site in the Nahua Tetzcoco” is the fact the Mesoamerican women seemed to be very domestic, because in the story, Ana, was the one who cooked for the men who were coming. This shows that the influence of the Spanish society had began to grow in the Mesoamerican land. Some of the things that I have enjoyed in the Grant of a house site in the Nahua Tetzcoco story is how willing people were buy her brother letting her sister take some land for her family, and the rulers giving Ana’s family the right to do so, without having to do something for them in return of the grant. Another thing I liked from the story is the face that they all seemed to be willing to help each other out, and were not so barbaric. I have enjoyed reading the Nahuatl speeches and dialogues, because they have given me a better insight on how the people in Mesoamerica lived in the&amp;nbsp;1500’s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:100%;&#34; &gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;This week’s post will be about the readings on Nahuatl Speeches and Dialogues, more specifically, the excerpts from the midwife’s speeches from the Florentine Codex, Book &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;VI&lt;/span&gt;.  This speech discusses the rituals involved with the birth of a child and the differences in preparation of male and female babies.  Mesoamericans viewed women’s “duties” as a sort of war making.  Sweeping the floor was making war with chaos, for example, in addition to making war in giving birth.  This act was something to be proud of and was not viewed upon lightly, for women who had survived labor were highly regarded as bravely birthing a male physical warrior or a female warrior for the home.  When the baby appears, the midwife shouted war cries, “which meant the woman had fought a good battle, had become a brave warrior, had taken a captive, had captured a baby”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Much like everyday life to these Mesoamericans, births are also very much paralleled by gender.  When a male child was born, his umbilical cord was buried under the battle field, signifying the life he will live ruled by battle to protect his land.  Conversely, a female child’s umbilical cord was buried under the hearth, signifying that the female was not to go anywhere outside the home, for her sole duty was maintaining the household.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;It is interesting that the midwife stresses more to the female that her work will be hard and that she will fatigue and work hard to provide for the household, than to the male who will fight on the battlefield.  This shows how much importance is placed on the women’s work and how important their “battles” are.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;By today’s standards, this “putting women in their place” concept of women’s purpose to take care of the house would be seen as grotesquely sexist and demoralizing, yet in the Mesoamerican’s world, this system worked for them and each were seen as equally important.  Saying that women need to be in the kitchen is just as sexist as protesting that they need to be out working with men.  However, it is refreshing to read firsthand accounts about these people and how they are constantly working together for the betterment of their society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4551310302796999455-26266702787079495?l=laurenhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <title type="html">Death by Murder</title>
            <author><name>Chad Black</name></author>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to analyze the final document, the note pinned to the body of Maria De&amp;nbsp;Caravantes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Origins:  This document was written in Mixtec originally in 1684, which is a language of southern Mexico.  In it, the author wishes to explain why he murdered his wife (she was stepping out on him) and also demand that the person his wife was stepping out on him with be brought to justice (for adultery, I guess).  It is addressed to &amp;#8220;all of you lords who are officials (justices), the lord lieutenant, or the lord alcalde mayor, or the Nudzahui (&amp;#8216;Mixtec&amp;#8217;) officials.&amp;#8221; Presumably they are the folks who could bring the other man to&amp;nbsp;justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motives: The author wants Domingo, the man his wife (he claims) was having sex with, to be brought to justice for having extramarital sex with his wife.  He also wants to exonerate himself.  He blames Domingo for the murder of his wife (although it was he himself who did it).  He says &amp;#8220;[b]ecause of him I have  killed my wife.&amp;#8221;  He is trying to give a rationale for his&amp;nbsp;actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perspective: The author clearly feels pretty righteous about what he did.  He refuses to take responsibility for it, and seems to think that murder is the appropriate punishment for adultery.  He also places much confidence in the justices to whom he addressed the letter.  He says &amp;#8220;[y]ou will know lord lieutenant what to do, so that justice will be&amp;nbsp;done.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text:  The author recounts the several times he caught Domingo and his wife Maria together, and mentions the cape he tore off of Domingo as he was running away one of those times.  He presents this as evidence that it was Domingo who was the man, and says that if he denies it, &amp;#8220;[t]ake him to the rack, there e will confess.&amp;#8221;  In fact, he emphasizes in three different paragraphs that torture will make the truth come to&amp;nbsp;light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information: This documents, to me, says that folks took adultery pretty seriously during this time period (not that I&amp;#8217;m saying it isn&amp;#8217;t serious).  Serious enough to murder over, anyway.  The author seems pretty confident Domingo will get his just reward as well.  The law, then, probably also took adultery very seriously.  He also, in the letter, mentions where he is hiding out, so he must be pretty confident about being exonerated for the killing.  That says to me that probably honor killings like this might have been something fairly common, or at least not totally bizarre.  Now, if someone left a note on the corpse the media would call him/her &amp;#8220;the letter killer&amp;#8221; or something.  He also writes the cross several times, signifying that he is telling the truth.  He must have put a lot of faith in that, presumably because it was such a serious thing to do, to swear to the truth.  Or at least he believed that others would believe him because he drew a&amp;nbsp;cross.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;I found parts of this weeks readings to be somewhat dull. the speeches seemed very formalized and rigid. It sounded scripted if not coming from brainwashed robots. the enormous amount of pomp and fluff involved seems to a modern listener quite overdone. As of yet i see no reason to have to go on and on about how we are unworthy and may God have blessed your unworthy soul with a temporary health and oh yeah hello. Many who believe in Christ and God understand they are not worthy of his grace and that this life is fleeting, therefore health not a constant. the need to express this in greeting seems not only annoying but depressing also. Yes thanks for reminding me i am a sinner and that i am worthless, seems counterproductive really. The numerous addresses at a wedding also seem ridiculous. Granted at weddings the best friend and the elder say a few words to the bride and groom but the words chosen for the text, as said at each wedding, was overdone, and highly depressing for such a happy occasion. the elder greeting the groom/parents stating that this is good and may your son not shame you or bring ill on the family by his evil ways. seems like the speeches that were given could really kill the festive mood. the introduction of the Christian God into the Amerindian culture really formalizes the most simple of meetings: running into your mother/mother-in-law on the way to the market. all the extra words are unnecessary.  maybe with more time to look at the formalized speech patterns the reason for this phenomena will become clearer but at the moment im still missing it&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7292399274560322422-2728651932976323322?l=asfhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:Helvetica;&#34;&gt;First of all when looking at these selections of speeches and documents, one must keep in mind that all of these were transcribed or written down after the Spanish conquest.  This is important because it is known that the Spanish were in the business of spreading Catholicism.  So of corse, after defeating the warriors, the peninsulares began their reign of political, ethnic, and cultural domination.  This is evident in the speeches most notably in the dialogues and the testaments at the end.  In the dialogues their is talk of &amp;#8220;the Lord.&amp;#8221;  This Lord can only be taken as the christian god, Christ, which would have been taught by the friers.  Greetings include the lord&amp;#8217;s blessing, common again with teachings by missionaries.  The fact that the christian god is seen as the lord shows the domination of the spanish culture on the natives of meso-america.  The testaments at the end of the pdf show much more in terms of the cultural domination.  Amerindians have taken christian names, such as Martin, Maria, augustine, etc.  The presence of the christian god is also seen in these testaments.  The testament of Maria interests me as it is an amerindian women clearing her and some of her husbands&amp;#8217; debts.  First, the notion of debt in this testament is one imposed by the Spanish, or at least I presume it is.  This is due to, first of, the testament was made to Spanish executors, Miguel Garcia, Martin de Santiago, Anton Jacobo, and Juan de San Pedro, and secondly that the debt is to paid out in a monetary, peso.  Maria proclaims the debts as hers, even though some were acquired by late husbands.  None the less, Maria assumes these debts are hers and in order to make good on the debts, she is forced to sell her house.  Questions that come to mind, If not for the Spanish, would the Amerindian society have the notion of debt? and How far could a woman go to pay or rebuke a&amp;nbsp;debt? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:arial;&#34;&gt;  Although it seems that the parallelism of the Incan culture is vastly different from our own, there are many similarities. In the modern deconstruction of gender conventions, writers like Derrida have focused on the binary system of gender that is prevalent in western culture, their primary criticism being that, as we discussed, neither gender can be defined without reference to its differences from the other. Their proposed solution was a redefining of gender that would include broader definitions of the term. Unfortunately, our society has not, in general, moved very far beyond traditional conceptions.&lt;br /&gt;  The Incans, on the other hand, crafted a society that embraced the perceived differences between men and women and crafted a society based on the binary nature of gender. Their parallel belief system was nearly equal in its treatment of men and women, giving them each a hierarchical system according to class, with a male and female ruler at the top of society. Both genders had assigned tasks to further the success of their ayllu, and it could be argued that neither set of jobs was more difficult than the other. They embraced the fact that women were made for childbirth and men were made for protection and provision, but they did not see either role as more or less necessary than the other.&lt;br /&gt;  However, the system of convents described in the article by Garcilaso de la Vega does not seem to fit in this parallel scheme, since it involved only women. The virgins that were chosen for seclusion lived their lives without contact with the outside world, other than visits from the Coya and her servants. They were not given a choice in this fate, but they were revered as special servants of the huacas and the society in general, and the goods they produced were seen as more prestigious than normal ones.&lt;br /&gt;  When the Spanish arrived, the class distinctions that already existed within Incan society were exaggerated because of the way they fit into the social structures of the colonizers. The Spanish adventurers aligned themselves with the Incan nobles because they felt that their similarities in class standing outweighed their ethnic differences. For this reason, noble Incan women were often respected by the Spanish as potential partners, and their marriages were used as political alliances. This fit into the parallel structure of the Incans in a sense, but the male domination of the Spanish slowly began to affect this mixed culture.&lt;br /&gt;  Even though the Incan culture was still a binary definition of gender, it was in many ways more advanced than our own. The Incans celebrated the differences between men and women, and created a system of harmony. They also allocated specific jobs for women that allowed them to have a structured hierarchy within their own gender and a method of sustaining themselves and their families. This was a great help to the women as they began to interact with the Spanish, because they could hold their own and garner respect from men who were used to women being placed in roles of submissiveness and subjection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-8142823307875321293?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Though many often consider men to be the primary focus of the colonial period of the Andes (specifically Spanish men), the article by Elinor C. Burket, &amp;#8220;Indian women and white society: the case of sixteenth-century Peru&amp;#8221; proves otherwise. Yes women were often exploited by the Spanish conquistadors, but there&amp;#8217;s more to the story than this.&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Women&amp;#8217;s roles in their own Andean society were very important. They were required to spin and weave items that were needed in their household, and these items were also used as a form of tribute payment. Women also gathered and prepared food, cared for animals, raised the children, and participated in harvesting and selling goods. While the specific roles of men and women were certainly divided, they were both important.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Although individuals in Peruvian colonial society had very little social mobility, there was one specific way that women could move upwards. If they were considered to be beautiful enough, they might be selected to be a Virgin of the Sun. In this case, the women weren&amp;#8217;t being exploited in a sexual sense, however they were still subjected to strict rules, including lifetime celibacy. These women were essentially sacrificed to one of their deities, the Sun. By sacrifice I don&amp;#8217;t mean literally killed, but rather committed to service of the Sun. Their lives as they once were no longer existed. They spend their days weaving and spinning clothes for idols and preparing foods for sacrifices. While I suppose this was considered to be an honor for some (to be chosen as a Virgin of the Sun), it was still something that was forced. If a woman was chosen, she couldn&amp;#8217;t say no. This, to me, just shows another aspect in which women were controlled.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;In the case of the Spanish, the most notorious sexual relationship between the Europeans and the indigenous was rape. I think we can all agree that rape is an act of violence. Burkett suggests that the act of rape was actually symbolic to the conquest itself because it was a form of oppression and subjugation. Eventually, however, the Spaniards realized that if they married Inca women who were part of nobility, then their children would gain status in the Incan society. The Indians too felt that if their marriage to the Spaniards would help improve their position as well. Because of this, Indian women became vital to the Spaniards in a political sense. They learned the indigenous languages, learned how the society operated, and learned weaknesses of the society that they could use for their advantage. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, these marriages were beneficial to the women because there was a certain status that came along with being married to a white man.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Because of these relationships, we have to be careful about being so quick to accuse every Spanish conquistador of rape. Yes it occurred. But we can see that consensual relationships between Indian women and Spanish men occurred as well. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4101372912891888807-6935110353826395357?l=alegria-tristeza-history465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Well, The first thing that I noticed after reading several of the dialogues was that I felt like I was reading the bible.  The writing was though, very concise and clear (at least the majority of them).  Even on the first page of dialogues I could see the obvious use of gender roles that this society so firmly relied on.  I noticed this in the &amp;#8220;Congratulations to a married couple&amp;#8221;.  This piece declares for the man to not be lazy and lie in sleep, but to attend the fields and farm to feed the family.  And the woman, get in the house and sweep because that&amp;#8217;s what the Lord wants you to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motives of this piece are fairly obvious.  First, be holy and do not live in sin. there is a straight and narrow path that the Lord has set for the new couple and their livelihood relies on them following it.  Then, in a nutshell stick to your roles that society has placed on you but say believe it is for the Lord.  Since this couple is recently married it seems as if this piece is one last attempt to make sure that they follow their gender roles and conform to the ideal view of&amp;nbsp;matrimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perspective of this dialogue, although written by a noble, seems to me like a parent speaking to the new couple.  The speaker&amp;#8217;s tone suggest that he or she has, at some point in his or her life, conformed and performed these roles and assigned tasks to maintain functionality of the&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a relatively short text and is straight to the point that it is trying to declare.  It does give the information that is needed by the intended reader. At this time in history and from this piece it seems that the institution of marriage was primarily based on the work to be done for the Lord and household rather than on the foundation of love.  I may have interpreted this wrong but if this is the case than I would be surprised simply because of the overwhelming Christian influence in the&amp;nbsp;writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this sound similar to the idea of the battle against war for the men and the battle against chaos for the women?  As for the content of this particular passage, I think it is strongly influenced by the gender roles but the actual dialogue and writing is surprisingly clear and easy to read.  I notice the conviction of their religion and how often they speak of the health from the Lord.  The writing is extremely religious and polite while maintaining the ideas of &amp;#8220;do this because you are a man, and do this because you are a woman&amp;#8221;. Sometimes I feel like the people knew they had to do things just because they had to do them rather than having to be told it was for the Lord or to battle chaos (concerning the woman keeping the house neat and orderly).  But like today, its about conforming to an idea and this culture stuck to its ideas&amp;nbsp;firmly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;After studying the Indian the peoples in Andes during the sixteenth century, one would be able to conclude that women very much had a specialized niche within society.  It is also apparent that women had status and were valued, but somehow, through time, the image that has been painted of ancient women is one of&amp;nbsp;triviality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women were valued economically in the Inca society.  The divisions of labor were the only way to distinguish between male and female within a household; women were not subordinate to men, but rather, served a specialized purpose within the community.  The activities which women were held responsible for were no less critical than the responsibilities of the men because everyone worked to ensure the survival of the community at large.  There also existed a sacred group of virgins that were revered by society and were similar to priestesses.  Despite the clear value of women to Inca society, there still existed a few rather sexist elements within their customs.  For example, the process of donating bridewealth to a bride&amp;#8217;s family in exchange for the bride.  Although this was explained as a purely economic strategy of compensating the bride&amp;#8217;s family for the loss of a working member, the situation is still archaic and casts the woman as merely a product to be bought and sold.  Another instance of marked sexism occurred when women could only experience alternatives for their assigned economic and social status if they were beautiful.  Whereas men were offered alternatives based on their skill, women were only allowed alternatives based on their looks.  Men had control over their chances of progressing in society, but for women, it was the luck of the draw.  This, like the bridewealth, trivialized women, so although women were said to have equality in the Inca society, there are still instances of a discrepancy of treatment between the&amp;nbsp;sexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial element that has solidified women as secondary in this society throughout history seems to be the arrival of the conquistadors.  They so changed the lives of rural women that eventually, women were remembered as &amp;#8220;marginal&amp;#8221; people (Burkett 111).  The Spaniards demanded women for personal services which was a new concept for the Inca.  The women were required to attend to household services as well as possibly performing sexual acts for their masters.  Many of the women&amp;#8217;s lives were changed as they were involuntarily scattered from their familiar rural regions into towns and cities.  Spanish royalty was concerned about the treatment of these women and of the fact that they were not granted sovereignty to wed, and thus, they were basically enslaved.  Despite the attempt of the Spaniards to harness the indigenous women for their personal uses, many women still remained independent and an economically vital.  They controlled the marketplace as well as the distribution of&amp;nbsp;food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the attempts of the Inca women to stay independent, they are rarely noticed in history books in our present society.  A safe theory for explaining this phenomenon would revolve around the appearance of the Spaniards and their complete disruption of the Inca social&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;MsoNoSpacing&#34; style=&#34;text-indent:.5in&#34;&gt;The treatment of women around the time of colonization was discussed in class this week.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;What most people learn in school is just that the Spanish came to the Americas and brought along their religion and customs.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They imposed these things on the Native peoples of America, and it was supposedly better for everyone in the end.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, many horrible, even inhumane, acts were committed by the conquistadores.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The native women were often raped and taken from their tribes.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They were seen as below human because they were not “civilized”.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But who were the “civilized” people in this situation?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Obviously the Spanish could not have been.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These things were happening all over the New World by all countries who were exploring and claiming the lands of the natives.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Portuguese were also very guilty of performing such acts in what is now Brazil.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not only were the women treated horribly, but the men were too.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They were killed or enslaved, neither of which were good options.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNoSpacing&#34; style=&#34;text-indent:.5in&#34;&gt;The question of coercion was brought up in class.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I believe women were coerced by the Spanish from the beginning.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They were forced into doing things they did not always want to do and if they did not do these things, they faced severe consequences.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So it is obvious that they were coerced.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Incan men were fading fast because of disease, murder, and enslavement.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;Women often had to marry Spanish men just because there was no other choice but to stay single and support themselves, which was near impossible given the status of women in society and the jobs they were allowed to have.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNoSpacing&#34; style=&#34;text-indent:.5in&#34;&gt;It seems to me that the Native societies were much more advanced morally than the Europeans were.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Europeans may have been more advanced as far as technology is concerned, but issue of equality between males and females remained a problem in Western culture until the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, and is still problematic today.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These early Andean societies had already figured out that all people were equal and should be treated that way.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is unfortunate that women took a step back after the supposedly more advanced society took over the area.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6697380513905424547-9024208591220321800?l=latinsexuality.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;In the readings this week we focused on Andean Women and it seems their change after conquest and their marginalization from society, at least from history. Elinor Burkett points out several changes that led to this occurrence. She discusses the greater impact on rural women and also migration and social and economic biases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marginalization of Indian women was bad enough before the Spanish came, but after the conquest seemed only to get worse, especially for the rural Indian woman. Burkett claims there are two major reasons for this: the first being the modification of the tribute requirements under the Spanish. Under the previous system the community would pitch in to help take care of the widows and the elderly, however under the Spanish system it seemed that the majority of the labor fell to the widows. The labor expected of the men of age didn’t seem to change however widows were expected to perform the same work load as if they still had a husband and a fully productive economic unit. The second major reason for heightened impact on rural Indian women was the character of the labor demands. The division of work fell into the agricultural labor preformed mostly by men and the household duties still called “women’s work”. The new demands on women forced some of them to leave the rural areas altogether and migrate towards urban centers. Also, much of the migration done during this time was involuntary. Women were enslaved or married off to the Spanish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue of marginalization for women came from the Spanish “conquering” everything. The Spanish felt that women as well as villages could be conquered. They could intermarry with the indigenous tribes and take their offspring could take positions in both societies. Mostly the Spanish men felt that they could force the women into submission and simply take what they wanted. These Indian women were not only victims of their economic status but also based on their race and their sex, factors in which they couldn’t or were never given a chance to change. In many history classes we learn of the conquering Spanish and how great they were to come and civilize the native peoples but it seems the older we get I suppose the more history teachers think we can handle and thus go about completely changing everything we’ve always known. In reading the documents from this past week it seems the Spanish did nothing but take and pillage towns, villages, and women.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5046261271286358878-3536682178776914312?l=tparton2.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;Everything was divided into distinct, completely separate male and female spheres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;Men and women were seen as completely opposite as represented by the separate spheres that each sex represented such as sun and moon, lightning and rain, morning and evening, and sky and earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;These views worked for these people and constituted a nice flow for the workings of everyday life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;Daughters were linked primarily to their mothers and sons to their fathers, forming matrilines and patrilines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;Likewise, surnames were passed on from one gender parent to the same gender child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;There were also parallel lines of inheritance where the mother passed down her lands to her daughter upon marriage and death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;These lands received by women, remained the woman’s own property upon marriage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;Effective labor units involved both the male and female working together on different tasks within the home and community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;There were distinct line of these male and female tasks that were essential for the maintenance and reproduction of the household, society, and the empire&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p  style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-family:trebuchet ms;&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;However, everything changed when the Spanish invaded the Andes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;The Spaniards strove to immediately uproot everything of the Andean society for the sole purpose of their own wealth and prestige.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;According to Spanish law, women were legally minors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;In order for women to obtain goods or property, they had to obtain permission from their male “tutors”, or husbands, and could not dispose of it on their own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;On the other hand, land received by women from their mothers or anyone could be sold by their husbands without their permission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;If that wasn’t demeaning enough, women were sometimes locked up by colonial administrators and forced to weave and spin for their own profit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;They were essentially used as slaves not only for economic gain but for sexual use also.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;While women were seen essentially as equals sexually in the pre-Spanish invasion and permitted to engage in sexually activity, as long as both parties were willing, they were now seen as sex-slaves and concubines to the Spanish conquistadors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;Many of the men that did not abandon their families because of the harsh conditions of the militia service took advantage of this new society of male dominance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;They now had a sense of ownership of their female relatives, essentially pawning them to the intrusive, destructive&amp;nbsp;Spaniards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p  style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-family:trebuchet ms;&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;It is really sad to see the decent that women underwent during the invasion of the Spaniards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;Everything was working cohesively for them and their families until the Spanish turned everything upside-down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:100%;&#34;&gt;Women equality is supposed to constantly move forward and it is disheartening to see it take a huge step back for the furtherance of Spain and its greedy&amp;nbsp;conquistadors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Going over this weeks readings and going to class has taught me that, not all societies from the past were all dominated by the males in the relationships.  I understand that it was not completely equal in the Indian relationships, but they had many parallels that were not very common for that time, in the world.  It is nice to know that they seem to have a lot of respect for the women in their cultural.  They seem to have a good grasp on how important women are in society.  Unlike the Spanish society having the men rule, and for the most part, treating women like second-class citizens.  They both come from different world and it is a bit crazy too see how much the Spanish society changed the world for Indians.  I know that some good came out of this, and it did change the world, but I would of like to see more of a mix for both culturals in this emergence.&amp;nbsp;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also going over the readings I was very surprised to learn how some Indian women wanted to get married to Spanish men.  It seem to me that there have been a few reasons for this but the main one was probably because some Indian women wanted to move up to the noble class.  It is also surprising to me that some Spanish men wanted to be involved with Indian women because it would seem that cultural from the past with more money and or technology would be the upper class cultural and for the most part they did not want to mix with the lower class cultural.  For example, going back to 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia the English men did not mix with the Indian women, other than John Smith and Pocahontas, because the English men looked down upon the Indians, and did not want to mix with&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another theory of mine could be that sicene the Incans had a very elaborate décor the Spanish men could of seen the Indians as equal or even more wealthy then them, because of what they had, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;GOLD&lt;/span&gt;, and the Spanish men could of found the Indian women attractive. I guess what I am trying to say is that, not only having the Indian women married Spanish men to raise higher in the noble ranks, but maybe the lower class Spanish men would of seen the upper class Indian women as high nobles and could of married the Indian women to gain nobility.  For the most part I think this is a good expiation of the mixing of cultural, they are not raciest, but rather wanting to move up in the noble ranks, who know maybe it could have been because of true&amp;nbsp;love!!!&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;One could generally say that all relationships are defined by inequalities in power and the subsequent dynamic that results - whether struggles over that power or symbiotic existence within the hierarchy. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Within the Andes when considering the indigenous tradition of marriage before and after the arrival of the Spanish, women&amp;#8217;s power, pursuit of power, and exhibition of power certainly have changed. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, marriage within indigenous communities both expressed the perceived equality between the genders through the necessity of mutual desire by each parties and their families in creating a union (Silverblatt 153) but further promoted women&amp;#8217;s perceived economic value through the presentment of a bridewealth (Burkett 103). These Incan rituals are consistent with the indigenous perspective of interdependence and reciprocity, granting women unique, significant social, cultural, political, and economic roles in the community. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, with the arrival of the Spanish, these traditions changed, as person was largely defined by their market value. According to Burkett, &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;the relationship between Spanish men and Indian women must be viewed as part of the total conquest and, indeed, part of the very meaning of conquest (105).&amp;#8221; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While according to royal policy, indigenous women were free to marry whomever they chose and even encouraged to marry, statistics reveal telling points about the power dynamics of marriage in the colonial period of Spanish America. According to Burkett, largely only the upper-class women, who already were endowed with great social and political power were the ones to intermarry with the Spaniards; therefore, the supposed benefit from this connection to power is questionable due to these women&amp;#8217;s now relative decline in power (yet their situation would have perhaps worsened had this alliance not been made. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For most women, the interracial power dynamic was most keenly felt through the encomienda system and the perpetuation of the tribute system. Through these two systems, Spanish males controlled production - both through property and labor; therefore, they both found occasions to encourage and restrict marriage for the women under their &lt;i&gt;control. &lt;/i&gt;As Burkett notes, Spanih men attempted to prevent women from marrying at all in order to continue sexual control over them and to maintain tributary production (when a woman married, she contributed to her husband&amp;#8217;s encomendero). Another tactic for Spaniards was encouraging intermarrying between their indigenous servants and thereby increasing the labor for their tribute. Each of these relations is characterized by a monopoly of control by the Spanish man and a lack thereof by the indigenous women, instead being manipulated to conform to his will (perhaps for any number of reasons). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Burkett&amp;#8217;s statistics (116) support these ideas of Spaniard power influencing marriage traditions. Because a woman&amp;#8217;s choice to marry or not marry as well as whom to marry were directly affected by Spanish rule (not even the abstract idea but by a woman&amp;#8217;s particular Spanish male overseer), it is plain that marriage became a coercive institution with the arrival of the Spanish. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-2092517124910307381?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;This week was an interesting introduction into the course. The Andes is a very interesting place wit ha diverse ecosystem and a wide array of animals and plants. It&amp;#8217;s no surprise then that the environment had such a huge impact on the people who lived there. The shape of the land encouraged a kinship between different peoples in order to gain access to the food in the separate zones. What interests me the most is how the Inca Empire rose out of this area and then extended as far as it did along the Andes. This huge society was made up of millions of people which a specific set of rules that kept them all in line. Everything was strict and kept in check including food, living, roles of people and all of this was different for males and females. The reading under the Guaman Poma de Ayala went into detail on this, explained how punishment was given for certain offenses and how whoreish woman were dealt with. Men and woman were categorized in 9 different groups by age and each group was expected to do something specific until a certain age. Men generally ended up serving in the military around age 20 and women stayed and took care of children and weaved and made things. Crossing many of the rules set in place by the Incas was normally punished by death or something equal to what was committed. They even had a set of rules for the mentally or physically handicapped and these people often lived in the same area together but were still given tasked based on their&amp;nbsp;disability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this article I came to realize just how advanced this civilization was compared to those around them. Technologically they were behind the Europeans during this time but as a society and culture they were quite advanced. Especially with the vast size of their empire to be able to control that many people and do it for so long takes a lot of work and time. I often wonder, as I&amp;#8217;m sure historians in this field also think about, what would have happened if the Spanish had not arrived and dismantled this society how would it have turned out centuries later. Would there be a huge power in South America like there is in North America or Europe and Asia and also what records could have been recovered or found had the Spanish not destroyed a great deal of it. Of course we&amp;#8217;ll never really know the answers to many things but it still makes one wonder just how much was wasted from many similar invasions like&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors, women in Incan society were, at least from my perspective, not necessarily viewed as inferiors to their male counterparts.  Rather, they too were recognized as vital sources of economic contribution to their respective households.  It is true that men were typically the “representative” of the family, but that does not necessarily presuppose that women were not distinguished benefactors to the sustentation of their families.  This, naturally, sheds a new light on the allotment of goods to the family of a newly wed bride from the husband’s family.  This was done as a way of compensating for the loss of the woman’s economic input for the family.  Women were also important to early Incan society in religious respects as well.  Certain women were held with such high religious regard that no Incan males would dare to approach them in any kind of physical&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            However, all of the customs and traditions for women in Incan society were figuratively thrown out the window upon the arrival of Spaniards.  The Spanish, unsurprisingly, held minimal regard for the native ways of the indigenous peoples that they encountered.  Thus the Spanish treated the Incan women exactly as they saw fit, which of course was not precisely similar to the treatment that they had been previously accustomed to.  I am of the opinion that the ensuing changes brought about by these European conquerors had an entirely negative effect on Incan&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            The Spaniards did not have the same appreciation for the value and contributions of indigenous women as the native men did prior to their conquering.  The restructuring of Andean society by the Spanish was absolutely based on an aggressive and authoritative mentality towards the aboriginal peoples.  The Spaniards utilized women as a tool of this.  In raping the Incan women, or forcing them to become their brides, the Spanish displayed their dominance over the natives, physically and wholly.  Also, bearing children or marrying the right women was a faster way for many Spaniards to be considered members of the community and less as invaders or outsiders.  The importance of women was quickly measured less by their economic and religious contributions, and more by their value as tools of political&amp;nbsp;advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            It is true that many women would willingly or often intentionally wed themselves to a Spaniard.  However, when this was the case it was usually for the advancement in lifestyle for the woman and her children.  In a sense I find this trend a mere tool of climbing the social ladder.  These marriages were, to me, unfortunate because it was often what the women were reduced to in order to preserve themselves and their families.  It is deplorable that in order to do this women had to take part in these political marriages.  It was, to me, no more than women being forced to “work inside the&amp;nbsp;system.”&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Female virginity seems to be sacrosanct in several different cultures, and the Incan society is no different from others.  In Garcilaso de la Vega’s El Inca one reads about the women of the Sun. These women were chosen specially because of their beauty and social status. The women had specific tasks such as making clothing for the royalty. What were more important than their tasks were them preserving their virginity forever. This was done in two ways. First, the women were kept in seclusion away from all other people. Even their male servants were not allowed to talk with them, but only bring them food and necessities. Second, there was a severe punishment for anyone that violated the women. Not only was the violator killed by being buried alive, the virgin was hung, and the violator’s entire family was killed. These prescriptions were used to prevent anyone from perpetrating such a vile crime as to take one of the women of the Sun’s virginity. This system is similar to other cultures from around the world. The Roman’s had the Vestal Virgins, Catholics have nuns, and then there is the most famous virgin in history: Mary, the mother of God. It seems that female virginity is sacrosanct to many different&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a cursory glance at the obsession with these virgins, it would seem that sexism is not a problem because these women are held in higher regard than men. Yet, that is just as sexist as trying to oppress women in societies rather than letting them be equal. Women are hardly allowed to serve in combat duties in the American military system. They say it is because the American public could not handle seeing women coming home in body bags, as if a woman’s life is more precious than a man’s. Yet this type of discrimination is just as bad as making women stay barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen. True equality comes from valuing both sexes equally and not valuing one greater or lesser than the other. However, there is one distinct problem with this analysis. The idea of sexism cannot really be applied to faith and religion. People’s limited, mortal perceptions cannot compete with divine authority and truth. If God or Vira Cocha or the “higher power” reveals themselves as male or female it is not a patriarchal system or matriarchal system. It simply is. Therefore, if these women, like Vestal Virgins, women of the Sun, or Catholic nuns serve a divine purpose, arguments on sexism and egalitarianism cannot be applied. However, the intrinsic need in societies for women to be virgins still remains outside of divinely sanctioned people. There is still the double standard that men are allowed to practically have sex with any number of women, but the woman must be pure for marriage. The dichotomy is telling about people that so many cultures and people value the female&amp;nbsp;virginity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;                The position of Andean women within pre-Spanish conquest and post Spanish conquest seems relatively rigid but this rigidity took vastly different forms. Elinor Burkett claims the impact on Andean people after the conquest affected rural Indian women more versus the affects it had on rural Andean men. She even speculates that Spanish conquest perhaps opened up different opportunities to Andean women that had not been open to them under Inca rule. This view seems somewhat controversial, and it seemed strange to me. It is my natural inclination to assume Spanish conquest had mostly negative consequences to all Andean people, that the relationships between Spanish men and women were in fact inherently coercive. There is no doubt in my mind that many or even most of those relationships, whether they be servants, mistresses, or wives, were the conquerors exercising their authority over the conquered. At the same time, there is also no denying that some women saw the benefits of such relationships. There were benefits of entering into such a realtionship willingly which leads me to believe that perhap not &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of  the relationships were inherently or intrinsically coercive, because some women most likely saw these interactions as a means of moving up the social ladder or gaining some sort of superiority previously unreachable, as  her place within Incan society was often non-negotiable.  Either way the situation is perceived, as soon as the first conquistador set foot on the soil of the “new world,&amp;#8221; the lives of these people would forever&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                Andean society under Inca rule was built around the community as a whole, very unlike our individualistic culture today. The parallelism that existed within the society guaranteed everyone of each sex had a role to play and a job to fulfill whether it be within the home, or the political and religious structure. Each member of the ayllus was expected to pay tribute to the state based on the system of reciprocity. This was how they were able to survive in their diverse climate. If the tribute system is viewed in terms of the household, not the individual in which the man is merely the representative it is clear that each member is equally important to survival. In other words it is easy to see that women in Andean society were viewed as useful contributing members of their households. Marriage itself can be used as a way of reinforcing this idea. Instead of looking at the bride price as a sale of a woman from one man to another, it could also be  recognition of the fact that when a woman leaves her previous household, that the house will suffer without her contribution, at least according to Burkett. So, while individuals often had no control “over their social and economic movement,” a female was not a fundamentally inferior member of&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                Enter the Spanish and suddenly life, especially for the women is drastically changed. This is not to say the entire system would change right away. Some communities were left virtually untouched by the new conquerors in the beginning, however when the Spanish enacted a new source of tribute, it would be the women whose lives would be most affected. Men under Inca rule were already expected to give themselves in physical labor for the state, but now women were expected or maybe a better description would be forced to give their personal services as well. “The rape of Indian women was an integral part of the drive for submission that characterizes all conquest,” or so Burkett so straight forwardly states and I agree. It seems a likely course of action for men to express their authority in this way, but it can’t be completely disregarded that some women were accepting or even invited relationships with the Spanish. The conquerors needed some level of acceptance in Inca society, so marriage to an Andean woman was logical or even necessary. It also presented benefits to the woman as well. Kinship was so important among the Andeans that a marriage or even a child with a Spaniard could possibly improve their position.  These changes within society became all more evident with the existence of wills and documented court cases in which women defended their&amp;nbsp;rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                It seems the logical conclusion that women were exposed to Hispanic society in a far more intimate way than most men, even just as maids within a household; they were exposed to the habits and culture of the Spaniards. However, it could also be said that the Spaniard’s somewhat generic and narrow view of women allowed them this position. Viewed as submissive and relatively unaggressive, women servants were not considered a threat and men were sent to do hard labor while the women were sent into the parlor to&amp;nbsp;dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                The end result was the eventual and virtual decimation of the Inca culture. The parallel structure that had previously existed vanished within the new Spanish culture. Some flourished and many died but the Spanish had come and there was no turning&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s nice to focus on both men and women in Incan society, not just women. Sometimes when studying gender or even referring to it, we tend to focus on women, so discussing the effects of the Spanish invasion on both men and women in Incan society has been&amp;#8230;.refreshing. I believe we left class with the question as to whether the Spanish conquest was coercive or not towards women in power dynamics. So, keeping the theme of discussing both sexes going, I think that the Spanish conquest was obviously coercive to both men and women in all aspects of life. Silverblatt really focused on how this conquest affected women, but through this, we can see that the Spanish&amp;#8217;s economic and political way of life changed all of Incan society, including both sexes, especially with the privitization of&amp;nbsp;land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#8217;m being a little idealistic, but the Inca&amp;#8217;s seemed to have a communal respect towards the gender roles that kept life going. Yes, roles were different for men and women, but regardless, it seems as if all people were integral to the vivacity of the community. We talked about these kinship relationships with other communities in different niches, and this really seems thematic in Inca society. There was a different relationship with &amp;#8220;mother&amp;#8221; earth, an arguably closer relationship than any private land-owning, male-only political system that the Spanish brought with&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Spanish conquest developed, I do believe that there were different effects on the Inca men and women, due to the Spanish&amp;#8217;s unrecognization of women in political life, with possible subordination of women in private life as well. In agreeance with Burkett, women seem to have gotten the brunt of mistreatment during this conquest as their roles in the household and Incan way of life, which seems to have been respected prior, was really ignored by the Spaniards. Although women had new access into Spanish life due to these marriages, the Incan women really lost a meaningful part of their humanity as being an integral part of society. Sexual mistreatment occurred and it almost feels as if women were exploited into these marriages with more political goals among the Spanish agenda. I cannot imagine a more humiliating, degrading experience for these women, and am very grateful I never experienced it. The Inca men, as we mentioned, did not receive this &amp;#8220;access&amp;#8221; into the Spanish community, as the women did through marriage, but were also more threatening to the Spaniards. A complete upheaval of Incan community life was occurring, and both genders clearly sufferred in similar and different&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting is the kinship among Inca women that occurred during the Spanish conquest. Burkett discusses this in terms of women&amp;#8217;s roles in the economy, but I hope we are able to develop on this more in our discussions this coming&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;It is interesting to examine the extent to which Incan society adapted and transformed as a result of contact with the Spanish conquerors, specifically the impact on gender relations. Obviously the amount of contact with the Spanish varied from region to region and from rural to city landscapes, but it is obvious that in densely populated regions the two cultures clashed, resulting in definite alterations on previous gender relations. According to some historians like Elinor Burkett, indigenous women actually achieved greater influence in comparison to indigenous men. She attributes this phenomenon to several factors, including opportunities in marriage with Spanish men and an overall more allowing attitude towards indigenous women as a result of &amp;#8220;sexism mitigating racism&amp;#8221;. Irene Silverblatt, on the other hand, argues that Spanish law removed the rights of indigenous women previously held, particularly in marriage. She points out that under Andean customs women had independent rights over all goods that she inherited, a privilege removed under the the Spanish system where all decisions on such goods had to go through her &amp;#8220;male tutor&amp;#8221;. So that while indigenous women perhaps had greater contact with Spanish men, their overall rights were reduced in relation to&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To settle the question of how exactly gender roles changed from the Spanish conquest, specifically for women, it is essential to examine just how coercive indigenous women were in marriages with the Spanish. Did they simply conform to Spanish way of life and the &amp;#8220;destructive forces of colonialism&amp;#8221;, or did they exert enough control in a marriage as to preserve former Andean traditions and culture? Frank Salomon proposes that women were able to use their position to continue Andean lifestyle under Spanish rule. He cites an indigenous womanVilcacabra as an example perpetuating Burkett&amp;#8217;s idea of women having influence: &amp;#8220;The startling audacity of this Indian woman&amp;#8217;s ploy to manipulate marriage among the Spanish elite suggests she was in no way intimidated by her nominally servile position&amp;#8221; (338). Although there were select cases in which women were coercive in marriage, the evidence is lacking that majority of women experienced such privileges, and overall the indigenous women were likely another way in which the Spanish could implement their system. Silverblatt explains that sexual abuse was very common, destroying the &amp;#8220;ayni&amp;#8221; (harmony) that defined Andean relationships. Guaman Poma writes in a primary source that &amp;#8220;a man who rapes a woman shall suffer the death penalty&amp;#8221; (51). Yet such important Andean traditions were spit upon by the Spanish, and despite a few instances where indigenous women were coercive in marriages, as a whole the rights of women decreased as a result of the Spanish&amp;nbsp;colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The case of the &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_0&#34;&gt;Incan&lt;/span&gt; women in Spanish South America has an interesting duality in the place which they held in society after the conquest. On the one hand they had mobility as far as being able to gather together as well as work for and marry Spaniards. On the other hand the women were at times not permitted to marry by their employers and a part of the service they were involved in during the employment of Spaniards was sexual service. The inclusion of sexual service in the duties of the &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_1&#34;&gt;Incan&lt;/span&gt; women the Spaniards employed and the occasions where they were not permitted to marry because of the labor loss it would cause is clearly coercion on the part of the Spaniards but at the same time &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_2&#34;&gt;Incan&lt;/span&gt; women did often marry, with-in and with-out, the Spanish community, they worked the court systems to their advantage including, in some cases, going as far as getting permission to move to Spain via their mestizo children. The cases in which the women were subordinated and forced into near slavery by the Spaniards were individual unscrupulous individuals abusing their position. As discussed by Elinor C. &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_3&#34;&gt;Burkett&lt;/span&gt; only one fifth of the women married Spaniards, whereas most chose to either remain single, possibly due to the lack of &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_4&#34;&gt;Incan&lt;/span&gt; males, or marry male &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_5&#34;&gt;Incans&lt;/span&gt;. Though it was possible for these women to marry Spaniards some did not in the case of the Inca&amp;#8217;s daughter whom refused marriage to a Spaniard based on his being a lesser individual because he was a mere tailor and not of noble blood like she. As we discussed in class men in groups were viewed as dangerous where as women were domestic workers often seen in groups. Though some women may have been forced to commit sexual acts with their Spanish employers and kept from marrying the overall picture seems to be different. Women were able to work the courts and even move abroad; they could work together and marry if they chose to. Women were esteemed also in the &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_6&#34;&gt;Pre&lt;/span&gt;-conquest &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_7&#34;&gt;Incan&lt;/span&gt; society. &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_8&#34;&gt;Garcilaso&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-error&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_9&#34;&gt;de&lt;/span&gt; la Vega goes into great detail as to the honor it was for a woman to be chosen to go into the house of virgins and the extensive punishment involved should someone enter the house let alone violate the sanctity of these women. Death awaited anyone who entered the house and death to a man and his entire village awaited anyone who violated these women&amp;#8217;s virginity. These women were upheld as holy. The Incans were a parallel society with a Inca and a Coya. A society with more Equality than can be found in most places today.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7292399274560322422-8251738964064749521?l=asfhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Spanish-indigenous relationships by nature were coercive. In all circumstances this may not be the case, and especially when pertaining to nobility and the elite in the Incan community; however in the situation of the largest proportion of the population and the sheer nature of all relationships coercion was used in some form. In the case of nobility mixed marriages and arrangements may have been at times beneficial for a temporal period, yet even those arrangements often went sour and resulted in mistreatment of the females in&amp;nbsp;question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forced transition in religious doctrine proved to be particularly harmful to women and lead to many coercive and exploitive relationships.  In the church priests would extort tithes from the native population and from the women sexual favors with the fabrication that the act would remove sin or pay the fees. Furthermore, the power that Spaniards held over the population as a whole significantly reduced the power women held previously in society as religious leaders and prominent social figures. Religion to the Incas was more than a part of society, meaning that there was no separation from religion in their lives; their lives were formed by their religion. Women were a part of that, as seen in Guaman Poma de Ayala’s work &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;El Primer Nuevi Crinica y Buen Gobiero,&lt;/span&gt; the Sun god and his wives were and integral part of society and no one ever desecrated the sacred notion of the marriage. Moreover, women whom were married to the king, or even his concubines, were treated with much respect and honor for their dedication.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irene Silverblatt concludes her piece, entitled &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;In Women and Colonization: Anthological Perspectives&lt;/span&gt;, “The women in the puna are living in the ways our ancestors lived years ago, they are defending our customs, they are defending our culture”.  In her work she promotes the notion that the indigenous population had no connection to the brutish Spaniards. The Spanish are ruining their way of life and restructuring their entire civilization. This can be seen in the changing status of women as sacred, to merely objects to be sold and traded. This can be illustrated by the actions taken by the male members of the common class when faced with the possibility of forced mining labor. These men would trade or barter their female relatives to the Spanish in order to avoid the back breaking labor. Previously, this would have been unacceptable behavior.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These relationships, sexual and social, were by nature coercive because the Spanish though of women as objects to be bought, traded and sold as they saw fit. The Spanish sought to conquer the Incan civilization in every aspect of their lives, including the sexually. The relations in most cases were nothing more than carnal reincarnations and representations of their views on Incan society. The forced changes in politics and economic system exacerbated the decline of women’s status in the Incan Empire. It cannot be speculated that in every single case of sexual relations between a Spaniard and an Incan woman compulsion was used, however the nature of the interactions were, without question acts of conquest rather than consent and desire as the traditional Incan&amp;nbsp;norm.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Before starting this course I was vaguely aware of the difference between gender and sex. I knew there was a difference but probably couldn&amp;#8217;t formulate a definitive answer on the difference. Now I can begin to fully understand and appreciate the difference. I can see that there are so many different genders in the world and none of them seems any easier to deal with than the other, meaning there are still so many questions associated with each gender. I am willing to keep all this in mind as we tackle the subject of Latin America as the course progresses The first week of class has been quite enlightening for me. Due to the fact that our opinions are shaped by our socialization, (family, religion, etc&amp;#8230;) and the fact that I grew up here in east Tennessee with white middle class, southern Baptist parents I have had a fairly closed minded upbringing. Taking that into consideration when I formulate my responses to the readings and class discussions I would like to consider myself fairly open to new peoples and thoughts. The subject of Caster Semenya is interesting to me and as a woman I wonder if the tables were turned would it matter. At birth, especially in America if parents are presented with such a situation they are given a choice, to avoid later social conflicts. Caster’s parents made the choice of female and raised their daughter as such. During the Olympic testing it was discovered that Caster had high levels of testosterone and I wonder that if she hadn’t been beating the pants off of everyone would further testing have been done or the results of the original testing even mattered to anyone. She was raised female and was competing in the female races and it is my opinion that is where she should be and where she should be competing. If any other country had such a chance of winning would they not take full advantage of that? What about the girls in gymnastics? It is highly speculated that some of the girls of other countries don’t actually meet the age requirements. Does anyone pursue that further? What about all the steroid use? Is this case not the same as that? And yet in this case it seems that the world is concerned with only upsetting the delicate social balance set forth by generations of closed minded people without a clue of the actual meaning of gender or sex.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5046261271286358878-8219051602373691689?l=tparton2.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I thought that the episode of This American Life on Testosterone was a very interesting addition to our discussion of gender and sexuality, since it is essentially the hormone responsible for the differences between men and women, both biological and socially constructed.  While both men and women produce testosterone, men produce it in much higher quantities, thus contributing to the traits typically seen as masculine, such as aggresiveness and strong desires.  One thing I thought was particularly interesting was the account by the man who, due to an undisclosed medical condition, was temporarily without testosterone.  He described it as the complete loss of desire, which amounted to a sort of emotional blankness which he described as profoundly satisfying.  I liked the way he described it as bringing him closer to God (or god, whichever) because while he was describing his experience I kept thinking about what I, in my limited Western way, know of Buddhism as the attempt to attain spiritual satisfaction by extinguishing desire.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but imagine a view of testosterone as a force that grounds us in earthly pursuits, preventing us from seeing through to some greater spiritual calm, or something.  Of course, I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d want to follow this train of thought through to its natural conclusion.  Also, it seems that this view of testosterone has interesting implications for women as being more spiritually in tune.  Anyway, the description of life without this powerful made me think about testosterone in a way I really never would have&amp;nbsp;expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important point I took away from this episode was the way in which the contest between members of the show&amp;#8217;s staff to see who had the highest testosterone-levels between the men and the women, respectively, illuminated the relationship that men and women have to their own gender and identity within that gender.  While the men expressly hoped to have the highest levels among their group, which would affirm their masculinity (something I&amp;#8217;d be willing to bet every male wants, whether or not they&amp;#8217;d be willing to admit it), the women had much more mixed feelings.  This illustrated to me the point that, while it is clearly desirable for a man to be more masculine, it is difficult for a woman to determine whether it is better to be more masculine or more feminine.  While men can go full-steam-ahead in one gendered direction, women are put into the position of having to synthesize both their masculinity and their femininity in order to excel at the expectations placed on their&amp;nbsp;sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this makes sense, because these are difficult concepts to fully articulate.  At any rate, I would highly recommend following this link if you have an hour to kill and don&amp;#8217;t mind nasally&amp;nbsp;voices.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I must admit, prior to this past week&amp;#8217;s discussions, I have never thoroughly considered the differences between gender and sex and never entertained the thought that we have been forced into a niche in one of two strict categories:  male and female.  I am Indian and was surrounded with very staunch ideals intrinsic to our culture while I was growing up, and many of those ideals were extremely chauvanistic.  Because of the situation with which I was presented, I was acutely aware of the differences between men and women, and I focused on ways to avoid being solely defined on my femininity.  Since I was so involved in defeating the status quo of female oppression, I never had the chance to believe that more than just these two concrete realms of sex could&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I ponder the categories of sexes that could exist, I now wonder, is the battle of the sexes really between men and women only?  It now seems to me that leaving room for only male and female sexes completely disregards a large category of people who cannot precisely fit into either category and in turn, face a form of social injustice.  The hermaphrodite population most likely endures identity crises because society has left no room for them to be easily labeled.  They cannot safely be called male nor female, so does this make them an &amp;#8220;it?&amp;#8221;  Personally, I believe that hermaphroditism is now prevalent enough of a topic in our society that we can slowly evolve the way we perceive sex to include more than just the two categories.  But I&amp;#8217;m guessing that old habits die&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the issue of gender roles, I do believe that society has progressed somewhat to realize that men and women could possibly be equals.  That being said, I&amp;#8217;ve heard one too many sexist jokes to believe that people have really tweaked the way they perceive the independent woman.  It was mentioned in class that even if both parties of a marriage work outside of the house, the woman still handles the majority of the domestic work.  One of my best male friends recently made the joke that the ability to cook and clean is programmed into women&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;.  I just smirked and didn&amp;#8217;t take the joke personally because I knew it was a blatant lie.  The skills we possess are learned and not coded into our genome.  The jokes about women belonging in the kitchen will only stop when the male population slowly disregard the naturalized perception that household chores are for the woman to complete.  Because women are expected to handle the domestic tasks, this leads me to believe that when choosing a mate, the men instinctually seek out women that have been well-versed in the domestic arts.  In my opinion, this does not seem so far from the rituals of the Incans, where women were considered valuable based on what they could contribute to their community.  The process of exchanging the bridewealth in order to compensate the family for losing a working member shows that women were bought basically for their skills and possibly their beauty.  While women are not objectified as such in our society, it is still fairly apparent that they are considered more valuable if they know their way around a kitchen or laundry&amp;nbsp;room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend not to harbor extremely feminist values, but I&amp;#8217;ve learned from my own experiences how hard women will have to work in order to ever really be on an even platform with men.  We have to put forth much more effort, and oftentimes attain the label of &amp;#8220;bitch&amp;#8221;, in order to gain respect and success in comparison to our male counterparts.  I also tend to have an open mind.  While I personally choose heterosexuality, I believe that a broad spectrum of sexuality exists and eventually, society will become more tolerant of this&amp;nbsp;fact.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;A couple of links related to our discussion last&amp;nbsp;Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=220&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the episode of &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; on&amp;nbsp;testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href&#34;http://www.sportsscientists.com/2010/01/ioc-calls-for-treatment-in-sex.html&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a recent post on The Science of Sport blog on the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;IOC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s recent decision to propose treatment for intersexed/transitioned athletes, made in the wake of the Caster Semenya&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sportsscientists.com/2009/12/number-1-caster-semenya.html&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is that blog&amp;#8217;s review of the Caster Semenya story, the biggest/most important of the year. In part because that blog is based in South Africa, their coverage has been excellent since&amp;nbsp;summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tenured-radical.blogspot.com/2009/09/in-search-of-history-that-hasnt.html&#34;This&lt;/a&gt; post at Tenured Radical from back in September is interesting, as are the comments that followed it. &lt;a href=&#34;http://outsports.com/jocktalkblog/2010/01/22/ioc-and-gender-inquisition/&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is also thought&amp;nbsp;provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, we could provide &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=0&amp;pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=caster+semenya&amp;oq=caster&#34;&gt;more than a thousand links&lt;/a&gt; on the Semenya case. I think that fact points to the threat that people, events, actions, etc. pose when they pull on male/female gender&amp;nbsp;binaries.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;First of all, I would just like to say that after two weeks of the semester, I&amp;#8217;ve come to realize something about how professors like things to operate&amp;#8230;.not only should you have your game face on the first day of class, but preferably the day before. This class has been no different, and with such a complex subject matter, it has been a little bit difficult to process all of the information I have stuffed in my head these past two weeks.&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The idea of &lt;i&gt;gender&lt;/i&gt; being a socially constructed identity (separate from biological sex) is not new to me. However, I had never considered the specific factors which shape this identity. Things like education, family life, cultural rituals, etc. play a part in shaping gender. While we generally observe &lt;i&gt;male&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;female&lt;/i&gt; as the only two genders, I am learning to consider that there are others that exist outside of our binary means of classification. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;When studying one gender, we have to keep in mind that it is relational to the other genders. For example, how can we study the &lt;i&gt;female&lt;/i&gt; gender without knowing the characteristics that we attribute to being female rather than male? The answer is: we can&amp;#8217;t. I guess we have to accept this before we can be effective in studying gender as a whole. Also, it seems that our society in the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; has a problem separating gender from biological sex. Why is that? Why are we so unwilling to believe that a person&amp;#8217;s gender roles can be different from sex? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-tab-span&#34; style=&#34;white-space:pre&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;In class, we discussed the case of Caster Semenya, who identifies her gender as &lt;i&gt;female&lt;/i&gt;, though she has some biologically male characteristics. She has lived her life as a woman, and her friends and family all consider her to be &lt;i&gt;female&lt;/i&gt;. If she weren&amp;#8217;t such a talented runner, this information probably never would have surfaced, and she would be able to live her life in peace. While some feel that Caster should not be allowed to run in the women&amp;#8217;s races, I completely disagree. I feel like this is discriminatory towards her. If she were taking anabolic steroids to enhance her performance, then yes, she should be penalized. But this is not the case at all. She was born this way. She is doing nothing to enhance her performance. On the contrary, her biological body - which she was born with - allows her to be a good runner. As humans, we are all different, and Caster should not be punished just because her uniqueness gives her an advantage. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh and by the way, if anyone is wondering, the title of my blog &amp;#8220;Alegria de uns, Tristeza de outros&amp;#8221; is a Brazilian proverb which literally translates to &amp;#8220;Joy of some, Sadness of others&amp;#8221;. I felt this would be quite fitting for the topics in this class. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4101372912891888807-2118441026443663290?l=alegria-tristeza-history465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I have to admit that when signing up to take Latin American Gender and Sexuality, I had no idea what to expect. Sure, the terms sex and gender are thrown around all the time by history books, but I rarely bothered to delve any further into discovering the possible meanings or significance these words held. The term sex is used to describe the physical characteristics of men and women and here I naively sat, thinking there were only two possibilities. The lines have been blurred, and black and white are no longer the only colors in my mind. There is a whole other world completely shaded in grey, making all the clear set images our society has previously portrayed of men and women seem slightly empty and left wanting. Yet, this doesn’t even touch the idea of gender, which is more like the social construct of what men and women are expected to be. There is so much more wrapped up in that tiny word than its length first implies. Gender encompasses a whole range of ideas and thoughts that span centuries and geographical location. The complex details have not remained static throughout the whole of history, and though relatively ignored by many before this “age of feminism,” it turns out, obviously enough that gender and a society’s concept and understanding of the male and female has long affected human action, thought, and&amp;nbsp;lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all became so much clearer when this realization dawned on me during our class discussions this past week. Of course the study of gender and sexuality of any culture must be studied in order to fully gain a better understanding of that society and the world they inhabited. As obvious as it all appears, it seems a vital component often left out or maybe not fully appreciated when studying history. Joan Scott argued that gender was a “key category of historical analysis,” and that it was vital to study how “femininity and masculinity were culturally constructed in relation to each other in different&amp;nbsp;societies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so often guilty of seeing the 1950s woman in the housewife ad; flowered apron, rosy red lips, and perfectly coiffed hair, when imagining what characteristics women should possess to successfully fill out the role our gender calls for. Thankfully, the reality of that particular vision has faded somewhat from our society yet, we are still very much governed by these strict ideas of what is appropriate for men and women. These social constructs that bind our mind and actions have done the same in different ways in every culture across time. Anything from the ideal body image, to women’s role as a wife, mother, mistress, provider of the household, and position in political society has had a profound impact on the society as a&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having opened the proverbial can of worms, I am now ready and excited about studying looking further into the idea of gender and sexuality and the part they played in early Latin America.

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:100%;&#34;  &gt;T&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);&#34;&gt;his week’s reading by Mary Elizabeth Perry, With Stones and Roasting Spits: Moriscas and a Multidisciplinary Methodology for Studying Women in Golden Age Spain, was very thought provoking a really opened my mind to people of different beliefs and why they have those beliefs. It also got me thinking as to how much I judge other cultures and presume I know why they do certain things, when in actuality, there is no way to understand pure motives and beliefs unless you are an actual member of that culture or group. More specifically, the issue Perry brings up about women in certain cultures that wear veils. She writes that in the 16th century, Christian authorities banned Moriscan women from wearing their veils. These authorities believed they were doing the women a favor by freeing them from the men’s authority and control. The Christians and so many people in today’s world view veils as some kind of restraint and use of power by men. While much of that may be true, there is so much more to it than that. Those women who wore veils, no doubt, felt most comfortable with one on her head for personal modesty preferences. It also held symbolic cultural significance for the women who were being forced to put away their own identity and customs and conform to a different, unwanted Christian culture. The veils signified tradition that their hearts continued to cling to and was a way for the women to silently show their opposition to the persecution by the Christians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-family: arial;font-size:100%;&#34; &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-family: arial;font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:100%;&#34;  &gt;Today, when we look at pictures of veiled Muslim women in the Middle East, we feel sorry for them just because they do not fit our contemporary views of how women should dress; sexy. We subconsciously think that those women wish that they could dress more “fashionable” or “beautiful” but are restrained by their domineering husbands. While it is true that Muslim women dress almost completely covered because of their religion, which is male dominated, it is their culture, they do not know anything different, and it is what they are most comfortable in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-family: arial;font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:100%;&#34;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-family: arial;font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:100%;&#34;  &gt;This article has really got me thinking about how I compare other cultures to my own and judge the “rightness”, so to speak, of the things they do by my own traditions and the way I was taught. It caused me to broaden my views of other cultures and not to judge them “right or wrong” according to my beliefs, but instead to consider different worldviews and try to understand where they are coming from.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4551310302796999455-566367632173435703?l=laurenhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

Certainly a large part of socialization comes from exposure to the media. Children’s programs on television usually portray boys and girls very differently, taking care to make a distinction between Dora the Explorer and her cousin Diego, for instance. Dora wears a pink shirt, a bracelet, and a purple backpack while Diego has shorter hair and wears traditional boys clothes with his orange rescue pack. Still, both characters travel through imaginary worlds and have adventures involving some sort of admirable goal, because in modern education there is an emphasis on encouraging both boys and girls to have dreams and take on challenging, respectable roles in society. The media, and not just children’s programs, but major network shows and news programs as well, seems to be an easy place to develop equality between men and women and present new ideas regarding the concept of gender. So, if it were the primary force of gender socialization in society, gender might be a much more progressive notion than it evidently is in general practice. However, children also take much of their knowledge of gender from the examples around them, namely their family and other close role models. Most of the family similarities between one generation and the next, such as mannerisms and speech patterns, are learned through experience. Similarly, the socialization of gender is accomplished through the roles that a child’s male and female role models play in society. If a mother does all of the housework without question, her children are likely to believe that women are responsible for cleaning and laundry as a part of who they are. However, if a father does a good share of the cleaning and laundry and encourages the children to do their part as well, they will be less likely to view these tasks as gender-oriented. Today women are able to hold the same jobs as men, and certain qualities that were previously considered solely feminine, such as an interest in fashion, have become acceptable for men as well. Still, the concept of gender in the Western World is largely dichotomous, with room for a only a few exceptions and deviations. Even while tolerance is increasing, traditional views have strong roots in generations of rituals and rites of passage. Furthermore, the sources of power for men and women typically come from their differences. Neither gender can be described without listing its differences from the other. Men’s roles of superiority in past centuries were a motivation to continue the socialization of masculine and feminine characteristics, so that women understood their place of submission. Meanwhile, women have often created their own sub-cultures with hierarchies based on social class and economic status. Wealthier women were able to stay home and care for their children and their home, so these more “feminine” traits came to be associated with more powerful women. Today, however, powerful women are often thought of as those who are a part of the workforce, and such new associations of power are changing the characteristics that are associated with gender and, though more slowly, the process by which we are socialized to these concepts.  &lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7634753815842516515-675016936445059113?l=jmarti71.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Going to class this week has been very interesting and there are many new ideas of gender that I may have really not thought of too much.  Like most southern males I have seen gender in only two ways, male or female.  Yes I have known about homosexuals, hermaphrodites, and transgender people, and no I do not think that is so wrong, but having been raised in the south I have never been told to much about people who are.  So this new idea of gender has been making me think out side the box and try to have an understanding of how and what makes someone male or&amp;nbsp;female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past December I had the privilege to visit some of my family members in Southern California.  I have never been to a large city like Los Angeles, and it was a big wake up call for me, to see how different it was from East Tennessee.  My family took me on a tour of Los Angeles and ended up in West Hollywood, where there seem to be just as many homosexuals as San Francisco.  In West Hollywood my cousins introduced me to one of his college friends who was bisexual.  He seemed to be a really cool person and was very open about being bisexual.  He asked me a few questions about Tennessee, having heard that it was a bad place to live for homosexuals, and I told him that from what I have seen, he is right, for the most part.  Talking to him some more I had a better understanding about the homosexual lifestyle.  From what I got it was biological (mental), something that he could not&amp;nbsp;control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes me think that being male or female may not just be if someone has a penis or vigina, but it could be the mental state of the persons mind, being more masculine or feminine, and it can also be a mix of the two mindsets.  This thought also is strong in watching my older brother’s children grow up.  My brother has one set of twins and one is a boy and the other a girl.  They have grown up at the same time and same household. Knowing their parents they are very open and don’t make their kids do anything they don’t want.  They seem to be like average children, for example the boy loves playing sports and the girl hates sports and love every thing pink.  From time to time they like the same things but for the most part the boy likes masculine things and the girl likes feminine things.  I know that it may not just be as black or white as having a masculine or feminine mindset but it can explain a large amount of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Gender and sex have very distinct definitions that collaborate to create the norms of American society. Gender equating to the result of many years of the division of labor into two distinct groups and other societal factors that change frequently. However, sex has a genetic and physical connotation that stems from the observed genitalia of each individual. Each category affects American society and is a fundamental means by which everyone is judged, yet the stereotypes are constantly evolving and shifting to and from each category. In the past century things have drastically changed in America, and many new challenges to the status quo have emerged.&lt;br /&gt;
    As the decade of the 1910’s began, men and women had very distinct and definite roles; yet they were about to change drastically. Women’s gender roles were composed of domestic chores and child rearing. Pants were not socially acceptable fashion for women in many rural areas of America and women in the workplace were rare, and in the few cases where they were admitted to the force, jobs were very gender conscience, such as teachers and mission workers. As the decade progressed and the roaring 20s emerged this evolved into a larger pool of women with the addition of secretarial work and industrial textile mills in the acceptable positions for women. This remained unchanged until the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; era when women entered the positions their husbands left. However, the conditions, advancement opportunities, and equality of compensation were lacking as well as proper anti-harassment policies. These issues were fought for over the course of the century, and are still being resolved but great success has been made.&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, gender is at another cross roads in America with regard to homosexuality. As in the previous decade women and men were at odds with one another in regard to voting rights, equality in the workforce and equality in the home. In the mid 1970’s homosexuality was pushed to the forefront of issues in American society and many of the issues that these individuals are fighting for are not yet resolved. However, there have been some definite decisions made in state level policies. In the state of Tennessee it has been made explicitly clear that gay marriage is banned, yet in some states such as Massachusetts their unions have been made legally recognized.&lt;br /&gt;
A relatively new area of gender and sexuality has emerged in America, transexuality. In America these individuals are facing discrimination at similar levels as the previous fighters for social equality. Transexuals are changing the sex to which they were born and this is causing quite an uproar in many areas of the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. They have been victims of intense violence and blatant bigotry in political and social arenas. Gender and sexual issues in the American society are slow to actualize fairness and equality, yet as the process shows some significant improvements are&amp;nbsp;possible. &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;In our class discussions this week, we have been trying to define and understand gender, gender roles and sex. Sex, best explained by the character Joseph in the movie Kindergarten Cop as “Boys have a penis and girls have a vagina”; by the way, someone of you may not have been born when that movie came out…but I digress. &lt;br /&gt;     Unfortunately, gender and gender roles are not that easy to explain. For example, a few months ago on group email from my church a problem arose about a “women’s group”. I attend the Tennessee Valley Universalist Unitarian Church and our congregation has member who are openly transgendered. The problem arose when a “female” gendered member wanted to participate in a female (biological based) group and was told by the leader that since she has been born male, she could not participate; the focus of the meeting had something to do with menstruation. “She” could not participate because “she” did not have a uterus. This brought up an interesting issue for me; did a uterus make one female?&lt;br /&gt;     After suffering for nearly twenty years with severe and chronic endometriosis, I had to have a complete hysterectomy shortly after my thirtieth birthday. Now, by all biological aspects prior to my surgery, I was female. I am a heterosexual female, who married my (eventual ex) husband, had given birth to our three children, breastfeed them (until I figured out there is nothing wrong with making daddy bottle-feed at night) who stayed at home until they were all old enough to begin preschool. Though I hate the color pink (if you see me wear it, it is only because my children or parents bought it for me), I wear dresses and skirts, enjoy pedicures (there really are health and well-being reasons to caring for your toes), and must get my hair cut and styled every four weeks; I also have naturally curly hair, so if it gets too thick, I have really bad migraines. My favorite place to shop is Talbot’s and I love taking a nice, hot bath after my children go to sleep. All “girly” things, right? So just because I no longer have reproductive organs and take hormones, does not mean I am any less of a female, or does it?&lt;br /&gt;     Then there’s the “male” attributes that I also seem to demonstrate too. For example, in my divorce, I have been called a frigid, relentless bitch that has to be in charge of everything; I am fairly certain though that since my (ex) husband is mentally ill, I can ignore most of that. I do agree with me having more balls that any grown-up male member of my husband’s family, but that too is not a physical attribute, only a values one. I also am the one who scoops up the dead sacrifices that our cats leave as an offering on our door mat, even though I have three boys whose arms work perfectly fine. When my youngest son wants worms or bugs, I am the one helping scoop them up into cool-whip containers for show and tell. As a teenager and young adult, I was expected to work right with the male employees for my parents painting company (and did) and the only exceptions made for me were with regards to using the bathroom; obviously I cannot pee behind a bush. I prefer to wear pants and played sports in middle and high school. I also was on the rifle, skeet and pistols teams and can fire a weapon, though I think hunting animals will only be a sport when they give deer and quails their own guns. I was (and still am) a complete tomboy, and apparently better equipped to handle three rambunctious male children than their father was/is. Actually I thank God most days for giving me male children; the only exception, having to deal with the tween who will not wear deodorant. Does that make me any less of a woman? &lt;br /&gt;     What about gender roles themselves. When I was growing up, both my parents required me and my brother to fold clothes, sweep and mop, etc. Both of us had to change our own oil, clean gutters, and I preferred (and still do) to mow the grass, while my brother would chase butterflies. My husband had a maid and nanny; this explains his attitude towards cleaning, it woman’s work and beneath him. However, our children have been and will continue to be raised to clean, cook and care for themselves; I truly believe their wives will thank me. Oops. That too was a gendered comment…&lt;br /&gt;     I still have not figured out whether or not having female reproductive organs defines me as a female. I still feel like I did before, before I got married, before I bore three children, a fact that physically widen my hips for the rest of my life, and before I had my hysterectomy. I even still have the stretch marks that helped defined my rite of passage into “motherhood”. I am also definitely still  heterosexual; even after all being drug through this painful over two year long divorce, I still have to say I am totally into men, just not *#!holes. I think being male or female with regards to gender, is simply one’s own choice and their ability to maneuver their choice within the confines of their society and culture. &lt;br /&gt;     And with that, I am off to wash out my pantyhose to wear tomorrow…&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7008857291755206886-4544892618630520535?l=heatherrussellwilder.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Joan Scott writes in chapter one of “Gender and the Politics of History” about certain historians attempts to read and study about women in history. They call this study “herstory.” The concept of “herstory” is ridiculous and perpetuates the sexism and chauvinism that the feminist historians are trying to abrogate. There is a certain Marxian tone to the concept that there needs to be an entirely separate history just for women. This notion is the opposite of chauvinism and is actually separating the sexes even further. Different methods exist for dealing with a type of history that only focuses on women, and most of these are also sexist. One approach is to try and collect information on historical women to demonstrate their similarity to men in history. This approach would have some semblance of egalitarianism if it did not intend to focus on women and not study men as historical actors. Another type tries to be revisionist in nature; this is not necessarily bad, but it looks at periods to try and demonstrate the men have continuously “subjugated” women. Yet another approach tries to bring together information about indigent and noble women in history while working under the assumption of female oppression in a patriarchal system.  The final approach looks at female culture and how women must live domestically instead of taking control of their lives. This fails to see the aspects of women’s culture that were enjoyed and actually encouraged by women during these&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott asserts that “herstory” has had excellent results and contributions to the overall study of history. She writes, “By piling up the evidence about women in the past it refutes the claims of those who insist that women had no history, no significant place in stories of the past” (p20). Scott’s description is accurate, but it is also flawed. The problem with piling up the evidence for specifically women is that it does not relate the two sexes together. If people are to truly understand history then both men and women must be studied together to comprehend the mass complexity of times in which they do not live. This myopic approach to history will prevent true equality from happening. It is perfectly acceptable for certain historians to want to study specific aspects of history that are woman centered, but overall there needs to be an amalgamation of the information for equality in a historical view to happen. If historians only focus on “her-story” or “his-story” they will not see the complete picture that so enriches the “stories of the past” Scott discusses in her book. This is not to say that the study of women is not important because it is. However, equality can only be achieved if neither sex is valued above the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;According to dictionary.com, &lt;i&gt;education &lt;/i&gt;is &amp;#8220;the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself and others intellectually for mature life.&amp;#8221; This definition highlights two important phenomena: it is through education that our gender becomes naturalized (or a primary way or doing so) and through education that we come to observe and understand that gender naturalization. This demonstrates how thorough naturalization for the majority of people is - reconsidering, questioning, and challenging &amp;#8220;traditional&amp;#8221; gender roles never occurs. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The gender-sex system, through its essential propositions, is ethically problematic. By designating &amp;#8220;proper&amp;#8221; social roles immediately and subconsciously associated with a sex, the gender-sex system eliminates choice and disregards greater variation within the system, both in regards to sex and gender. However, the manner in which the system is perpetuated (such as in education) therefore veils its agenda for direct gender-sex assignment and reduces the likelihood of public disapproval, with people instead considering the system a source of predictable comfort or an inconvenient constrictor of choice (but not an inherently unjust institution that is poisoning society). Therefore, this system is particularly problematic for those who overtly do not fit into the gender-sex system binary but is actually problematic for all. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If one were to poll people about the number of sexes and genders that exist in a proverbial &amp;#8220;on the street&amp;#8221; sort environment in various countries throughout the world, what do you think the range, mode, and average responses would be? I am guessing 2 for each. We live in a society constructed by binary norms, with the distribution of power often dependent upon one&amp;#8217;s conformity to the gender model endowed with power - male. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In our class discussion beginning over Joan Wallach Scott&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;Gender and the Politics of History&lt;/i&gt;, we began to discuss Scott&amp;#8217;s central theme: &amp;#8220;woman as subject, gender, and politics&amp;#8221; - a terse but loaded phrase. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SUBJECT&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In providing &amp;#8220;herstory&amp;#8221; and providing various perspectives and accounts to women&amp;#8217;s contributions and roles in history - emphasizing their agency in society - Scott asks if these approaches will and can possibly supplement historical records and knowledge without &amp;#8220;rewriting history&amp;#8221; as we know it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I too wonder about the transformation that might happen in our celebration of the past. Here I am reminded of an expression that I have known so long I cannot even remember when and where I learnt it - &amp;#8220;Behind every great man there is an even greater woman.&amp;#8221; Further, this sort of approach not only might rewrite the past but guide the future by promoting female agency through a glorification of the past and further active struggles for greater gender equality. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;GENDER&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While most of the world does still live in a binary gender-sex system, this dichotomy has changed some. In our discussion, we noted the differing degrees of acceptable departure from the gendered norms for men and women, with women having greater latitude. Why is this the case? The international community has recognized the need for greater gender equality, both fulfilling ratified international conventions&amp;#8217; clauses of such entitlements as a human right and furthering economic growth (as demonstrated by countless studies). Following this international reform movement granting greater rights to women, women have taken on traditionally &amp;#8220;masculine&amp;#8221; roles and behaviors at an exponential rate, and doing so has become increasingly acceptable. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, the opposite - men taking on traditionally female roles and behaviors - continues to receive overwhelming opposition and ridicule as a general rule. Why this double standard? Why must men be so manly? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;POLITICS&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Scott emphasizes how gender and politics interplay and therefore must be analyzed in relation to one another. For example, she highlights how the political defines and infiltrates every aspect of our lives (whether we know it or not): &amp;#8220;Since political structures and political ideas shape and set the boundaries of public discourse and of all aspects of life, even those excluded from participation in politics are defined by them&amp;#8230;. the private sphere is a public creation.&amp;#8221; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This particular quotation brought to mind a recent event on campus: We all know and feel that the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is an academic institution situated in a very politically conservative community, and perhaps its social policies have reflected its fear of condemnation from or even connection with the surrounding environment. However, I recently learned that &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;UTK&lt;/span&gt; is decades behind other institutions in its policies and resources directed toward &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LGBT&lt;/span&gt; people. This year a Resource Center is planned to be opened, but it apparently has insufficient funding to operate fully. It has finally come to the administration&amp;#8217;s attention that faculty and staff should receive &amp;#8220;Safe Zone&amp;#8221; training, which promotes an open and welcoming environment toward &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LGBT&lt;/span&gt; people and encourages frank and honest discussion. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Clearly, the political and cultural climate in the South generally upholds the gender-sex system. However, apparently even among the marginalized and &amp;#8220;non-traditional,&amp;#8221; there are tensions toward those who are outside of their own schemes of normalcy. For example, among the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LGBT&lt;/span&gt; community, transsexuals are often considered outsiders who do not belong to any group. Again, the binary conceptions are expressed, though this time from a place one might not expect. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-1086599150470265076?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I suppose the subject of our recent class discussions that I personally found the most interesting and engaging was the way in which the world determines and classifies gender.  I took a particular note at the discussion of the existence of numerous genders, not simply the typical male and female genders that we as a society are largely accustomed to.  I myself, up until this past week, was under the general impression the sex of a human being was either male or female and was mostly oblivious to the grey zone of gender that lies between the two.  However, this week’s lectures, readings, and classroom discussions were quite revealing to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            Since our studies began to delve into the details of defining sex and gender I have found myself attempting to resolve why we have become so narrow minded in our perception of the two.  It seems to me that people would rather the situation be, as they do in innumerous other matters, be a matter of black and white.  That is, simple and easy with no doubts or apprehension of the affair.  I am confidant that for most people the perception of what sex is and what it should be comes from their cultures, which are typically steeped in traditions and&amp;nbsp;religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            Historically speaking, there are hardly any cultures that take the many variables of sex and gender wholly into account, at least not when addressing matters such as family, marriage, and community.  In many civilizations across the globe, the ideas of what are expected of people are nearly uncanny.  A male is typically expected to mate with a female and the two are to raise offspring together.  But as our lectures have proven, this simply cannot be the case for every human being.  What about people that are born with the genitalia of both of these sexes?  Or in many cases a man or a woman may in fact be homosexual or bisexual and would lack the desire to follow these traditional ways of life.  These people are typically labeled social deviants in that they deviate from their cultural or societal norms.  Acceptance, or at the very least tolerance, of those who are of atypical gender or sex is, as a result of history, considered&amp;nbsp;progressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            But why did these cultures develop in such a way?  Why are there so few peoples who are not perturbed by sexual variance?  My personal reasoning for why this is comes back to what I consider a truism for all things, people fear what they do not understand.  An overwhelming majority of people across the globe is in fact either male or female and are heterosexuals.  Many of these people simply cannot fathom why anyone would stray from these guidelines of sex that they themselves follow.  Since they cannot understand this they must find someway to deal with it, and it is far easier to simply reject these variances and label them as wrong or an error that it is to accept&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just a natural human thing to do, but we as a society seem to enjoy explaining and categorizing things in a binary way. Black or white, tall or short, young or old, gay or straight, man or woman, good or bad, and the list goes on and on.  In all of my readings about gender and sexuality then it is of no surprise that we have these seemingly strict guidelines and boundaries to define who we are as individuals, each with certain roles to be played out.  In particular, gender and sexuality  have some of the most strict roles out of all of these&amp;nbsp;categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be the first to point out that my own personal experiences from family life to just having grown up in the south has played a major role in what my ideas of being a man or woman really means. Fortunately, as I was able to grow and experience life outside of these boundaries, I began to question these deeply traditional and embedded roles and really examine my own beliefs about what an individual could be, not defined solely by one&amp;#8217;s biological sex. As I mentioned earlier, though, we seem to be  so prone to to define ourselves according to our biological sex and in these binary terms, like heterosexual or homosexual and man or woman. This is where social forces and institutions have been shown to play a major role. In fact, socialization at a very early age, has a significant impact on how we believe men and women should behave , and anything outside of these &amp;#8220;norms&amp;#8221; is usually looked down upon. Just by discussing Caster Semenya and viewing her picture on the cover of an American magazine really emphasizes our society&amp;#8217;s ideas about how women, in particular, should be portrayed. I&amp;#8217;m assuming Americans breathed a sigh of relief seeing Semenya on that magazine cover looking very &amp;#8220;feminine.&amp;#8221; Do we really have to prove our sexuality&amp;nbsp;today???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Scott&amp;#8217;s article really pointed out, gender is a &amp;#8220;culturally determined&amp;#8221; term, and falling outside of these attitudes can pose problems. Regardless of these traditional roles that really define what it means to be a man or woman, I do believe that we are living in a time where these ideas are changing. Minorities are taking opportunities to really challenge these embedded roles about how a person should and should not act just based on biological sex. For instance, more women are entering the workforce,  while men are taking on more domestic roles (slowly, but surely).  My hopes lie in our culture learning to break through this binary outlook on life, especially in terms of gender and sexuality, where one is not necessarily better than the other, just different. Different ideas and beliefs are always &amp;#8220;threatening&amp;#8221; towards the majority, but I do believe it is our responsibility to learn to work and collaborate with others different from ourselves, whether that be in terms of sexuality, religiosity, or just simply, different beliefs in&amp;nbsp;general.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Our discussion in class on Thursday on the South African athlete Caster Semenya, an intersexed person (although her subjective identity is that of a woman) really hammered home for me how everything we think about gender is binary.  Man and woman are all that there is for most of us; group a or group b.  The existence of intersexed people kind of blows that out of the water.  The Intersex Society of North America (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ISNA&lt;/span&gt;) says that an estimated 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 children are born intersexed in some way.  That means that there are millions of intersexed people in the world.  Millions of people who are biologically distinct from out notions of male and female are out there living their lives.  Our thinking about gender, at least in the U.S., can&amp;#8217;t encompass the existence of such folks.  I guess that&amp;#8217;s why so many children are surgically assigned gender shortly after being born.   And the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ISNA&lt;/span&gt; supports assigning gender early on, although not surgically, &amp;#8220;depending on which of those genders the child is more likely to feel as she or he grows up&amp;#8221;.  For me this recalls the Argentinian film &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;XXY&lt;/span&gt;, about an intersexed young person living in Uruguay.  The mother of this person invites her friend and her friend&amp;#8217;s plastic surgeon husband (and their son) to visit, secretly hoping to persuade her husband and her child to consider surgical gender assignment (previously the child had been taking hormones to retard male characteristics from manifesting).  This backfires, with the child (called Alex, a gender neutral name) refusing to identify as either gender.  The father of this child tells the plastic surgeon that he knew his child was perfect the way it was from the moment it was born (he uses &amp;#8220;perfecta&amp;#8221; the feminine adjective though. he mixes genders throughout the film when speaking about his child).  Throughout the entire film I kept asking myself why the person would ever be made to choose.  Why can&amp;#8217;t someone deviate from that particular norm without some throwing a fit?  What does an openly intersexed person threaten?  What comes to mind is that it threatens the gender binary.  Why preserve an artificial binary, one that so clearly doesn&amp;#8217;t reflect humanity?  I can&amp;#8217;t see any good reason to preserve it.  The human race won&amp;#8217;t die out, cities won&amp;#8217;t crumble.  Is it so wrong to have to rethink about gender and about how gender is used in society based on this new understanding that our notions of gender are outmoded and outdated?  When I think about the kind of society I&amp;#8217;d like to see, it is one that is free of gender.  If gender is something artificial, that in the case of intersexed people has meant that hundreds of thousands have their genitals mutilated, that has meant queer people have been persecuted, isn&amp;#8217;t that something that needs to go? I, for one, could do without&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#8217;s discussion was very instructive. I had never thought of gender and sex as different nor had i ever really thought about the ideas of more than two genders. After discussing the ideas with a few of my classmates however I began to understand that there are numerous aspects to look at: What &lt;span class=&#34;blsp-spelling-corrected&#34; id=&#34;SPELLING_ERROR_0&#34;&gt;genitalia&lt;/span&gt; does one posses, does one fancy their own gender or the opposite, does one have body hair or breasts. In today&amp;#8217;s culture, especially American culture, sexuality is a highly politically charged and controversial subject. Ask a conservative what sexes there are and they will most likely state that there is male and female. If you were to ask many liberals they will probably say there is male, female, transgendered, and hermaphrodites. Debate rages as to whether it is appropriate for same sex marriages. Sex and gender differ in that gender is what is expected of a certain sex. For example: Men participate in sports, have relationships with women, provide for the family, and protect the family; whereas women have children, take care of the children and cook dinner and take care of the household. Outdated as these statements are, they provide a very clear idea as to what was once viewed as proper gendered behavior. So what is gender? Gender is the prescribed role a culture gives to a certain sex, learned from family, friends, institutions such as school, the church, or the boy/girl scouts. In America many see it as unseemly and shameful for a boy to &amp;#8216;come out of the closet&amp;#8217;. it is regarded as a shame for the family for a son to desire a boy, however in certain tribal cultures it was a rite of passage for a boy to become a man by &amp;#8216;receiving&amp;#8217; sperm from an older male. Whereas this practice has many falacies both moral and scientific the point is that it is a different point of view than our own. while this may not be the best analogy to demonstrate openness to new ideas it does demonstrate that other ideas do exist in this world. I am looking forward to this semester and continuing to look at new ideas and perspectives.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7292399274560322422-1378147874188866112?l=asfhistory465.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Farewell, Rwanda. John thinks that I have hated my time spent with you - experienced quite a culture shock. I do not think this is the case. I think living and working anywhere has its own challenges. Rwanda: the slow pace of life, the continuing reconciliation effort, understanding muzungu treatment, balancing an attitude of assistance without telling, determining what role to play, developing a life in such a short period of time surrounded by busy/transient people.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I know now that I can live and work in the developing world, though with the next place I will similarly have to adjust to its own unique challenges. I came. I worked. I conquered.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am glad to have come. I definitely feel like I grew. I learned a lot about myself by my interactions with others in and out of the workplace and mt reflections of my experiences. I am much more &amp;#8220;liberal&amp;#8221; than I expected.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Some random memories I chose to capture the morning I left - people and the important food.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1poiQ0BCSI/AAAAAAAAAOU/ZLtIF-MvgD4/s320/RwandaSummer09+1117.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429767238586534178&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1poiGXFNxI/AAAAAAAAAOM/U0H9J5uZBxU/s320/RwandaSummer09+1114.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429767235780818706&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1poh6oLmGI/AAAAAAAAAOE/_pc4mGCV45w/s320/RwandaSummer09+1118.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429767232631314530&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1poheJRV5I/AAAAAAAAAN8/CrtyAdRITvs/s320/RwandaSummer09+1110.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429767224985474962&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With that, thanks for listening.

                                &lt;p&gt;After learning of the weekly fun-time had at Torero&amp;#8217;s Trivia Night, I of course wanted to make a short-term habit of it. While the events were fun, the experiences made me a bit homesick, as I could not help thinking of Will and John - my dear trivia buddies (trivia masters they are) and my best friends. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At Trivia Night (the sequel), one of my teammates was a Brit whom I had never before met - he considered himself quite the veteran expert on Africa since he has been working here a few years. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He nonchalantly and matter-of-factly declared something I considered very controversial - &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can easily tell where someone is from by their appearance. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A  semi-debate ensued. I did not refute that that may be true but simple stated the complication and potential dangers in operating with such assumptions. He thought my logic was interesting though very &amp;#8220;liberal&amp;#8221; and often besides the point. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My point was this: Why draw those conclusions about people? What is the purpose and usefulness of such prejudgments? How can you judge the accuracy of such? Can you really divorce your geographic designation from other preconceptions associated with that geography? Does your preconception and subsequent categorization change your behavior toward that person and your expectations of their behavior? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I presented him with some examples of confounded identities due to globalization. How do we &amp;#8220;classify&amp;#8221; these people? How do they &amp;#8220;classify&amp;#8221; themselves? I think the idea is much more complicated and problematic than he was making it out to be. Individuals are individuals. I told him I don&amp;#8217;t want anyone to judge me, especially before meeting me - so why would I do that to anyone? He said that was interesting and asked if I was spreading this idea everywhere I went. No, only when I entered into this type of conversation. He said, &amp;#8220;Well if you don&amp;#8217;t like labels, never go to Sudan, etc. People scar and tattoo themselves to show what group they belong to.&amp;#8221; I responded, &amp;#8220;But that&amp;#8217;s different. Self-imposed identification measures are chosen rather than ascribed by an outsider based on perceptions or judgments.&amp;#8221; He conceded. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I tired of arguing. You can rarely convert people to your way of thinking. He appreciated my argument but will never agree with such a &amp;#8220;liberal&amp;#8221; way of thinking. It is interesting to see how I have grown, integrating influences from home and school. All I could think afterwards was John would have been so proud (plus Dr. Shefner) - if only he had heard me. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-7651147527051102738?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;As my time in Rwanda drew to a close, I began to review what I had accomplished and seen (and what I had not). As a sort of last-minute decision, I chose to go to Akagera National Park, Rwanda&amp;#8217;s version of a safari. As opposed to a few other excursion options, it seemed most cost- and time-efficient&amp;#8230;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Considering the robbery, this trip had cost me far more than I had anticipated, though I imagine I could have planned and budgeted better. I had such a short time left in Rwanda and had much to do before leaving; therefore, I couldn&amp;#8217;t rationalize taking a long trip, which would of course accumulate greater expense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I worked to assemble a group to go with me and managed to wrangle a few to go with me - two guys friends, Austin and Cesar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We arrived at the park perhaps an hour after it opened. I didn&amp;#8217;t think that I was that excited specifically about the park, merely glad to be participating in a specific offering of Rwanda, but I squealed with joy when I saw my first zebra (and again and again with each subsequent zebra and then my first giraffes and so forth).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1pPy3BG3EI/AAAAAAAAANE/VWVWqj_TXYk/s320/RwandaSummer09+962.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429740035929201730&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1pRo0gQGlI/AAAAAAAAANU/_Fe9zrff-0A/s320/RwandaSummer09+981.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429742062479088210&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1pRogZIA0I/AAAAAAAAANM/PpKTOLO5uxQ/s320/RwandaSummer09+966.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429742057080488770&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1pRpoGveyI/AAAAAAAAANk/LkDQ4DeWHhw/s320/RwandaSummer09+1006.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429742076330736418&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finding animals was sometimes a difficult task - and we didn&amp;#8217;t see a ton. So the &amp;#8220;safari&amp;#8221; was actually relatively costly, but it was still an awesome experience. Most of the animals, despite our proximity to them, seemed indifferent to our presence - they had certainly seen these curious creatures before.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1pRp17fPyI/AAAAAAAAANs/0yfw1xOIjg4/s320/RwandaSummer09+1052.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429742080041631522&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1pRpd0vanI/AAAAAAAAANc/XAwHqerffoM/s320/RwandaSummer09+1000.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429742073570880114&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-uW2Vj-yHYY/S1pR00NMJbI/AAAAAAAAAN0/CDeszO3TMFY/s320/RwandaSummer09+1068.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429742268557567410&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-745000171794321922?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNoSpacing&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-tab-count:1&#34;&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;The first week of class has sparked my interest in the relationship between gender and sex.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I, like many, have never really compared the two.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I have always just used them as synonyms for each other.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Now I realize that there is more to the concept of gender than just the scientific classification that sex is.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Things like the role one plays in society and culture are all a part of gender.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;MsoNoSpacing&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-tab-count:1&#34;&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;I have been thinking about how much culture has altered the behavior of people these days.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In class we were discussing about how humans would naturally act as far as sex is concerned.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We mentioned how males must spread their seed.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Many males still act upon these desires, but not all.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Some have been so affected by their culture, religion, and morals that they try to commit to just one mate and stick with her for life.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is not the way things should be in terms of biology.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The same goes for females.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Females are supposed to want to stick to one mate for protection while she raises the children.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, females today do not always stick to this.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The effect culture has on people is profound and often it goes without anyone questioning it.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This can be applied to a multitude of different topics, such as drug and alcohol use.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Society tells us it is wrong, but is it really?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One should take everything in&amp;nbsp;moderation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNoSpacing&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-tab-count:1&#34;&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;I wrote a paper on the effects of “choosing” a sex for children born with ambiguous genitalia a few years ago.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Doing this has horrifying psychological effects on a person.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Whenever they find out what has been done to them, it is very difficult to deal with.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Suicide is a result in an astounding number of these cases.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But what are the parents to do when their child is born this way?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Society forces people to choose one of two genders.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The child will never be accepted as a hermaphrodite by its peers.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In western culture, a child must grow up male or female, so parents have to make the difficult decision to choose genders.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is an awful situation because of the pressures of society.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Either way, the child is going to have issues in its life.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNoSpacing&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-tab-count:1&#34;&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;Often times I feel like the world would be a better place without a society that demands all people to be “normal”.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The cross burning in the yard of the homosexual that lived with his mother that we discussed is just ridiculous.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The man had never caused any harm to anyone in the area, yet was persecuted because of his sexual orientation.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I believe that things are getting better and people are becoming more tolerant, but there are still those who perform acts like this that make themselves look stupid and close-minded.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I hope my generation can get over issues like race, sexual orientation, and religion and just be tolerant of everyone.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun:yes&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6697380513905424547-5967937135643382870?l=latinsexuality.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;As I finally begin to settle into moto transportation, my healthy fear of motos, driver&amp;#8217;s cavalier attitudes, etc. is refreshed by an accident a couple of friends of mine had. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Austin and Verena were caravaning on motos. Someone pulled out in front of Austin&amp;#8217;s. The driver tried to stop suddenly - rather than swerving for some reason - and they flew off the bike. Verena, immediately behind them, saw the whole incident, and felt her vehicle run over something. She was immediately frightened she had run over Austin. But he seemed &amp;#8220;ok&amp;#8221; - Austin and the driver both were bleeding, though the injuries appeared largely superficial. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course a crowd quickly gathered to see the commotion. Many tried to detain the biker, who was trying to flee the scene - another testament to Rwandese&amp;#8217;s sense of community social justice. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Verena, though shaken, was very alert and concerned about Austin&amp;#8217;s open wounds remaining clean due to the threat of contamination, particularly &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, immediately following the incident, both Verena and Austin hopped right back on motos to get to their destination and away from the scene. austin refused medical attention, bandaging his sores himself. Since then, Verena has refused to ride motos, instead walking miles to and from work. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The accident certainly has made me rethink transportation options. I have begun walking more frequently again as opposed to shelling out a few francs here and there. When I do ride motos, I urge the driver to go &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SLOWLY&lt;/span&gt;. The message is either received mockingly or with genuine concern. I try to explain my reasons, telling the story of my friends&amp;#8217; accident through the language barrier, but with the possible understanding, there comes compassion. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-5600063406339676309?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Have you ever experienced the strange realization of loss - becoming conscious that you were without something and then subsequently missing something you did not miss until you realized you were without it and wondering how you could have never noticed before? (I hope you muddled through that.)&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had a most peculiar version of that recently - I saw a dog in my neighborhood in Kigali. In Memphis or Knoxville, this would be no extraordinary thing. Of course I would be a bit cautious with any stray or wild animal, but I am a passionate animal lover, particularly dogs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I saw this dog, it occurred to me - I have not seen a dog since I have been in Rwanda. Why? Why is this dog here now, out of the blue? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first time it the dog was lying up against the gate to my house when I arrived from work on a moto. I was quite startled, not knowing how to assess the safety of the situation (plus I had not received my rabies vaccine - global shortage). But the dog appeared calm and sweet, left a fair distance between us, and left when shooed. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, for the next week or so, she made continued appearances. Nearly every time I walked through the neighborhood, she would join me at some point, accompanying me at a safe distance. It is as if she could simply sense I am a dog person. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Curiously (and probably unfortunately), she does not seem to fear cars - only moving out of their way at the last instant. She was obviously previously cared for - I wonder why she suddenly appeared here and wish I could do something, but I know I cannot. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Throughout my encounters with her, I asked Tom about the curious lack of dogs in Kigali and Rwandan&amp;#8217;s apparent fear or disgust of them. He responded with an illuminating answer: during the genocide, dogs fed on the corpses. Following the genocide, Rwandans killed almost every dog - both to quell fears and ease memories. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-6076118302995716289?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;div&gt;When leaving &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;UOB&lt;/span&gt;, the vehicle we had wanted to take (a mid-size &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SUV&lt;/span&gt;) was low on gas, so we took a 5-seat truck instead - still seating all of us. This proved to be a stroke of providence as we made our way to another branch. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way to Bugasera, we encountered a large crowd of people standing in the village&amp;#8217;s roadway - rather unusual considering the nature of driving here (chaotic). Therefore, we were forced to stop. There appeared to be some sort of commotion; apparently, a man was injured and needed to go to the hospital. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Because we had the truck, we were able to take this injured man to the hospital along with his friend. We were not entirely sure where the hospital was located - it was much farther than we expected or would have liked - but we found it and helped this man. The whole situation was very odd, somewhat unsettling but uplifting as well. There are no notions of ambulances here. The conditions of the roads in the poorer areas may have worsened the man&amp;#8217;s condition, as the road was rife with pot holes. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;No one told us what became of him. It did not seem to matter. There was just an understanding and a sense of urgency about getting him medical care. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I was finally able to see the patient, his clothes were covered with dirt. He had abrasions on his head and arms, and he looked very disoriented. I think he may have fallen down a hill or something along those lines. Ross said that this is the third time he has served as a make-shift ambulance driver. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-4026679599472580179?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;It has been a summer of reading - and the more people I meet, the more common an experience it seems to be. Restricted availability of television. Only so many dvds packed in my backpack. Work schedules of comrades misaligned and/or everyone is fatigued from the long day&amp;#8217;s work. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#8230;All things considered, it is nice to just curl up with a book. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting, and ultimately my purpose for this post, many people seem to be reading the same fantastic book - &lt;i&gt;The Poisonwood Bible &lt;/i&gt;by Barbara Kingsolver, perhaps my favorite book. This novel has become almost a symbol of my time here, repeatedly brought up in conversation. I find it interesting that so many people are just now reading or hearing of this novel, one I read in high school - but better now than never. It seems particularly intriguing that Westerners already in Africa would choose to read this book, a book about the potentially destructive force of well-intentioned but ignorant Westerners in an African community. Reading &lt;i&gt;Poisionwood&lt;/i&gt; while in Africa would certainly lend another perspective than reading it prior to one&amp;#8217;s arrival or following one&amp;#8217;s departure. Something to consider. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Regardless, I find it refreshing that so many people are anxious to read and discuss this novel.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-7365818799961318984?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Like many people I had trouble distinguishing the words gender and sex. I always thought the two were swapped out to mean male and female. This class and Sacco&amp;#8217;s class have taught me otherwise and I now better understand it. Sex as we said it&amp;#8217;s basically male or female based on biological features. Gender is the act of being male or female or both. What was really interesting is how society effects the way we view gender, what is acceptable and what isn&amp;#8217;t. Long hair on a guy, women who wear baggy clothes, guys who wear tight clothes etc. The talk about Caster Semenya really got me thinking about how our society in America views others and how we compare those around the world to our own people. The question was if this girl was taking steroids or not and then it just turned out it was biological and out of her control but she was questioned based on looks but also how big of a margin she won. During this I started wondering about Serena Williams is a very buff woman and at times doesn&amp;#8217;t look very womanly but off the court despite her size is quite attractive. It&amp;#8217;s just odd where we draw the line, I mean the Williams sisters are the best women tennis players in the world so just winning a lot can&amp;#8217;t be the reason, I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing we talked about were gender roles in our society and what a man is expected to do and what a woman is expected to do. I can see where many of them stem from and it&amp;#8217;s no surprise that the majority of men think woman should do this and that and vice versa. I believe it to be a joint effect of family and society that mold the minds of others to believe these roles. I&amp;#8217;ve known of men that are the cleaners of the house because their g/f or wife is just messy or even that same thing for cooking and there are plenty of women who take charge of the family instead of the man. I&amp;#8217;m a very clean person myself, I hate messes or things just lying on my floor and it surprises people to come to my apartment and see it a mess because of my roommate but then see my room and basically call it the safe haven. My point in all this mess is gender roles should not be assumed for men and women because &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s just how it is&amp;#8221; or anything like that. Life is complicated and nothing is just black and white and genders and sexes surely are not black and white which is why we live in these &amp;#8220;Gender&amp;nbsp;Wars&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history465/blog/history-465-post-1.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Looking back on all that was discussed  this past week, the comparison of gender and sex and how we conceptualize both in our society generated the most thought and reflection in me. To be honest it was a little unusual delving into the realms of philosophy, sociology, and even the sciences in a history class, but soon after discussion began it was obvious how clouded my perception of gender in our own culture is, and how necessary it was to &amp;#8220;flush out&amp;#8221; where these perceptions originated in order to better understand gender and sex relations in a different time period and geographical&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is truly difficult to step outside one&amp;#8217;s self and examine how one&amp;#8217;s own perceptions developed through a lifetime of socialization. Undoubtedly, I am largely the person I am because I was nurtured that way, but even so I tend towards certain things that are exactly opposite of the background I come from, that can only be explained by something genetic. Where do my ideas about sexes and gender come from? Partly from what I am told by society, but also partly from my own observations. Our society tells us many things about what certain sexes can or cannot do, but many of these are actually confirmed to be truth, although some are not. Our society is often discriminatory as to what a man can do versus a woman in the working world, or in the social world, or in a marriage, and such discrimination is typically wrong. On the other hand, there is no doubt what is biologically classified as a &amp;#8220;male&amp;#8221; is superior physically when compared to what is classified biologically as a &amp;#8220;female&amp;#8221;. No female (scientifically defined) has approached the standards males have achieved in almost every area a human can be tested&amp;nbsp;physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads undoubtedly into the discussion of people like Caster Semenya who seem to be somewhere between a male and a female biologically. Are there only two sexes? Well no, not technically. As was discussed in class there are likely 5 or more, but any sex other than male or female is classified as being the result of a genetic error because other sexes account for such a small fraction of the overall population and come about as the result of the body acting as we perceive &amp;#8220;abnormally&amp;#8221;. Interestingly we often view such abnormalities as bad things whereas other cultures throughout history often looked favorably upon such occurrences, claiming them to be acts of God. Such different viewpoints can only be explained by differences between our society and others.  This ties in to the statement I initially made, which was that it is necessary to be able to step out of our perceptions and examine how they came about, because by discovering the origin we discover the reason for the way we act and the choices we make, and our understanding of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt; society is much greater. Likewise, when studying gender/sex relations in Latin America if we are able to discover how they came about and why they were the way they were, we will gain much greater insight into the historical events that took place. We will better understand why they took place and will understand the role of relations and its impact on&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The first thing we must do this semester is set each of you up with your own blog. It&amp;#8217;s very easy to do. There are many free blogging services out there, the two most popular being &lt;a href=&#34;blogger.com/start&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Wordpress.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, what is a blog anyway?&amp;nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2I1pWXjXI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will your &amp;#8220;news&amp;#8221; stories be? Well, they will be summaries, reactions, and critiques to our weekly readings, lectures, and discussions. Your blog is your own personal space on the web in which to interact with this class. Of course, it is also a public space. Everything you publish on your site will be fed directly onto this one, and also available to the world. Keep that in mind as you write. Your audience is me, as your professor, but also your colleagues in class and anyone else who might stumble upon your humble corner of the&amp;nbsp;internets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to begin? Well, Wordpress.com has simple instructions for registering your own blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.support.wordpress.com/getting-started/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.support.wordpress.com/introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also start with the how-to video from &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.tv/?s=wordpress.com&#34;&gt;wordpress.tv&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;http://wordpress.tv/2009/01/05/signing-up-with-wordpresscom/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve registered a blog, make sure to email me with your name, your blog&amp;#8217;s name, and its url (that&amp;#8217;s the blog&amp;#8217;s web address). Once you&amp;#8217;ve done that, feel free to customize your space anyway you&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This week we read an article about Eugenio Sinayuca, a kuraka from the same region (around Cuzco) as the famed rebel (rebel) Tupac Amaru.  When Tupac Amaru stepped up to rebel against the (local, anyway) Spanish government, Sinayuca did not step up with him.  And the reason he did not step up with him was not because he was a supporter of Spanish rule.  In fact, he was resolutely anti-Spanish rule.  He did not rebel due to petty personal politics.  He was allied with a local corregidor, Antonio de Arraiga, and Tupac Amaru was an enemy of the said corregidor.  Nevermind that this particular corregidor was famous for his abuses of the reparto.  In addition, Tupac was allied with the local bishop, who had excommunicated Sinayuca because of his support for Arraiga.  Sinayuca apparently valued his personal relationship (who was, again, a noted abuser of power) over the possibility of throwing off Spanish rule.  He may have felt that the few communities he governed were better off in servitude and destitution by mita than possibly harmed fighting for their freedom.  One wonders how many other class collaborators acted due to similarly petty reasons.  Might the rebellion have succeeded if these corrupted betrayers of their own people had been braver?  Of course we&amp;#8217;ll never&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;em&gt;Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance&lt;/em&gt;, authors Alexandra Parma Cook and Noble David Coook discuss the case if Francisco Noguerol dfe Ulloa and the legal/lady troubles he had to go through.  Essentially, our boy Francisco promised to marry a lady in Spain, did to get that dowry money, and then was like &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m bouncing to the New World&amp;#8221; and then did.  Later he hears (from his sisters) that the lady with whom he was married had died.  So later he remarried and got talked into going back to Spain by new wife.  When he did he was immediately arrested because his first wife was suing him to force him to come back to her and also to recover her&amp;nbsp;dowry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Spanish law crazy was that all of the beginning legal battle was done while Francisco was in Peru and while they had no confirmation that he even knew what was going on.  His mother and the brother of his new wife had to do all the legal proceedings for him.  And then when he did finally arrive he was arrived and his property was taken and then he had to mount his legal defense.  And from then on there was a ton of nasty things said, documents reviewed and written and exchanged.  All this was overseen by some judges (with no jury because they didn&amp;#8217;t do that kind of thing) and there was lots of changing of minds.  Eventually Francisco prevails. &amp;nbsp;Insane.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Jose de Acosta was a Jesuit big wig who wrote a treatise on converting indigenous Americans called &lt;em&gt;How to Provide for the Salvation of the Indians&lt;/em&gt;.  He was there in the late 1500s.  Essentially, he says that while its been tough going converting the Indians (he mentions the cruelty of the Spanish conquerors/colonizers as being a major impediment), the Indians will come around, just be patient and keep at it.  He draws examples of people who didn&amp;#8217;t take to it right away from the Bible, although not being a Christian I didn&amp;#8217;t really get his examples.  Its refreshing to me that he seems to consider them to be human beings, and to be worthy of compassion and respect.  Still, his utter lack of consideration for their own beliefs is baffling to me (not that anyone else we&amp;#8217;ve read about has been any better).  I can&amp;#8217;t understand how someone can be so set in their beliefs as to completely disregard the beliefs of others, especially in regards to religion.  In that sense, no matter how smart he is otherwise, Jose de Acosta is as blind and ignorant as&amp;nbsp;anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;One of the readings we had to do this week was from &lt;em&gt;Andeans Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, a chapter focusing on the cultural exchange between indigenous Andeans and their European conquerors.  Of particular interest to me was the process by which Spaniards created a written version of Quechua, the language of the Incas (or at least the ethnic group that created the Incan empire). The author, Kenneth Andrien, made a very interesting point: that creating a written version of a language that had been very much an oral one only would have a very profound impact on how people communicated and how people kept their history.  At first glance, it seems like it shouldn&amp;#8217;t.  After all why wouldn&amp;#8217;t it just make it easier, more consistent?  But what Andrien says is that using the Latin alphabet to represent Quechua words was only a loose approximation.  So the immediate problem is that its corrupting the way it is spoken.  And because stories and histories were written and not collected mentally, that changed who kept them and who created them.  Which would drastically alter the way a culture created and maintained&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the idea of written language is so ingrained that its quite hard for me to think about a language that isn&amp;#8217;t written.  Bewildering really.  To have to change to a written one would be so disorientating and have to challenge the way one thought about truth and the trustworthiness of one&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;memories.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the Spanish in Peru would have figured out that if you expose people to new diseases, disrup their entire way of living and producing their livelihoods, kill many in war, then it might only make the situation worse to force them to pay large amounts of tribute and work in dangerous silver mines and crowd into towns.  We&amp;#8217;ve been discussing Viceroy Toledo and his solution to the rapidly decling Indian population (and what he cared about, rapidly declining contribution to Spanish wealth), which was the repartimiento.  And yet it only made it worse.  Couldn&amp;#8217;t he have figured out that if something was working before you showed up, it might be a good idea?  Its remarkably arrogant to think that you can just toss out the old ways, completely unexamined, and then force your new ideas on the situation and think  they will work.  History of course proved Toledo wrong; his policies didn&amp;#8217;t help.  And yet it shouldn&amp;#8217;t have taken historical hindsight to figure it out: people who are dropping like flies from disease shouldn&amp;#8217;t be forced into silver mines or have to pay large amounts of&amp;nbsp;tribute.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The Werner Herzog film &lt;em&gt;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&lt;/em&gt; details the disastrous 1560 adventure into the Amazon by some Spaniards (and their indigenous slaves) from Peru in search of El Dorado, a city full of gold to be stolen.  Of course El Dorado was just made up by clever indigenous people who knew exactly what to tell the Spaniards to give them a monetary hard-on.  Also, of course this was not the first disastrous expedition by greedy Spaniards.  There had been more than a few others that turned up nothing and got them lost, killed, or both.  In this particular adventure, the expedition is taken over in a mutiny by one Lope de Aguirre and things get real bad.  The film and real life (or what can be constructed from letters and testimonies from the time) agree on some points.  However, the departures are interesting and in my opinion they serve only to give a more negative opinion of Lope de Aguirre (not that I&amp;#8217;m saying he deserves to have a good opinion about him).  However, knowing more gives me a somewhat less awful opinion about him.  For one, maybe because the confines of the movie did not allow him to do so, there is no exposition of Aguirre&amp;#8217;s past.  Knowing that he was one of many adventurers who came to Peru to make it big and didn&amp;#8217;t kind of puts his mutiny in perspective.  It makes it see somewhat more radical, especially after reading his letter to Phillip &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;.  Additionally, knowing that he killed the commander, Ursua, right away instead of holding him captive after wounding him and then later hanging him, makes his actions seem more human, less insane.  Lastly, the end of the film is wildly inaccurate, and Herzog seems to go out of his way to make him see crazy (which I&amp;#8217;m sure he was, a little bit&amp;nbsp;anyway)&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;What struck me most about the reading from James Lockhart&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Spanish Peru: 1532-1560&lt;/em&gt; was the chapter devoted to transients, that is people without jobs, houses of their own, or a source of steady income.  He starts by debunking sources (letters from colonial officials of other Spanish colonies) that claim that Peru had thousands and thousands of transients (7,000 plus) and only a few gainfully employed colonizers and some encomenderos.  Using notarial records he shows that in fact there were not nearly that many (only really 2,000-4,000).  Which is really surprising, because that&amp;#8217;s a pretty significant although not 7/8 like previously thought.  Its hard to understand how a couple thousand people could live without working in what was basically the edge of the world they knew.  Lockhart says that encomenderos would take on up 20 or so semi-permanent &amp;#8220;guests&amp;#8221; to show his wealth and have a group of people he could obligate to do things.  Which seems to be a real awk situation.  He also says that others just gambled away the time and looked for expeditions to unexplored regions that they could latch on to.  It is really surprising that such a stiuation could go on for years without anyone putting a stop to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
