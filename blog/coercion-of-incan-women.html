<p>The case of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Incan</span> women in Spanish South America has an interesting duality in the place which they held in society after the conquest. On the one hand they had mobility as far as being able to gather together as well as work for and marry Spaniards. On the other hand the women were at times not permitted to marry by their employers and a part of the service they were involved in during the employment of Spaniards was sexual service. The inclusion of sexual service in the duties of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Incan</span> women the Spaniards employed and the occasions where they were not permitted to marry because of the labor loss it would cause is clearly coercion on the part of the Spaniards but at the same time <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Incan</span> women did often marry, with-in and with-out, the Spanish community, they worked the court systems to their advantage including, in some cases, going as far as getting permission to move to Spain via their mestizo children. The cases in which the women were subordinated and forced into near slavery by the Spaniards were individual unscrupulous individuals abusing their position. As discussed by Elinor C. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Burkett</span> only one fifth of the women married Spaniards, whereas most chose to either remain single, possibly due to the lack of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Incan</span> males, or marry male <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Incans</span>. Though it was possible for these women to marry Spaniards some did not in the case of the Inca&#8217;s daughter whom refused marriage to a Spaniard based on his being a lesser individual because he was a mere tailor and not of noble blood like she. As we discussed in class men in groups were viewed as dangerous where as women were domestic workers often seen in groups. Though some women may have been forced to commit sexual acts with their Spanish employers and kept from marrying the overall picture seems to be different. Women were able to work the courts and even move abroad; they could work together and marry if they chose to. Women were esteemed also in the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Pre</span>-conquest <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">Incan</span> society. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Garcilaso</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">de</span> la Vega goes into great detail as to the honor it was for a woman to be chosen to go into the house of virgins and the extensive punishment involved should someone enter the house let alone violate the sanctity of these women. Death awaited anyone who entered the house and death to a man and his entire village awaited anyone who violated these women&#8217;s virginity. These women were upheld as holy. The Incans were a parallel society with a Inca and a Coya. A society with more Equality than can be found in most places today.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7292399274560322422-8251738964064749521?l=asfhistory465.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article></div>
