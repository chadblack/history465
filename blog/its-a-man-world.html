<p>This week during discussion we talked about women in the nunnery during and how they had to live by certain rules if not the Inquisition could bring them up on charges. Women especially women in the church were closely watched. They had to uphold their beliefs and never questioned it or do any thing that would bring any attention to them that would also questioned their faith as well. A person we been talking about concerning this topic is Sor Juana. She was a scholar and also a nun in New Spain. We currently watching a movie entitled I, the Worst of All. This movie was somewhat a depiction of Sor Juana life. This movie showed how a nun in Mexico during the seventeenth century was looked down upon because of being vocal in her beliefs, when the only way for a woman to be was to be submissive towards a man. This movie showed that Sor Juana was a woman before her time. She was very intelligence and introduced new ideas that were very foreign. Her ideas were not favor because she was a woman and much thought that her ideas went against the church. Many people in the church wanted to bring Sor Juana in front of the Inquisition but Vicereine was protecting her. The Vicereine took a certain interest in Sor Juana because of her charm and intelligence. She also loved Sor Juanaâ€™s poetry as well.<br />I feel that Sor Juana was a very intelligent woman and that she was misunderstood by many especially the men around her. These men in my opinion were somewhat threaten by her intelligence and were jealous of how she was favored by so many. I think they also viewed her as a threat against their faith but should had just gotten to know her and understand her views. Sor Juanan was just exploring the world around her but also stay true to her faith. She wanted to somewhat uplift women in her country and enlighten the world of things they never knew about that might could make people understand themselves better.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/811234197297643948-5916456923779601287?l=ras2011.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article></div>
