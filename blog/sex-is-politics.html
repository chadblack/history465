<p>According to dictionary.com, <i>education </i>is &#8220;the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself and others intellectually for mature life.&#8221; This definition highlights two important phenomena: it is through education that our gender becomes naturalized (or a primary way or doing so) and through education that we come to observe and understand that gender naturalization. This demonstrates how thorough naturalization for the majority of people is - reconsidering, questioning, and challenging &#8220;traditional&#8221; gender roles never occurs. <div><br /></div><div>The gender-sex system, through its essential propositions, is ethically problematic. By designating &#8220;proper&#8221; social roles immediately and subconsciously associated with a sex, the gender-sex system eliminates choice and disregards greater variation within the system, both in regards to sex and gender. However, the manner in which the system is perpetuated (such as in education) therefore veils its agenda for direct gender-sex assignment and reduces the likelihood of public disapproval, with people instead considering the system a source of predictable comfort or an inconvenient constrictor of choice (but not an inherently unjust institution that is poisoning society). Therefore, this system is particularly problematic for those who overtly do not fit into the gender-sex system binary but is actually problematic for all. </div><div><br /></div><div>If one were to poll people about the number of sexes and genders that exist in a proverbial &#8220;on the street&#8221; sort environment in various countries throughout the world, what do you think the range, mode, and average responses would be? I am guessing 2 for each. We live in a society constructed by binary norms, with the distribution of power often dependent upon one&#8217;s conformity to the gender model endowed with power - male. </div><div><br /></div><div>In our class discussion beginning over Joan Wallach Scott&#8217;s <i>Gender and the Politics of History</i>, we began to discuss Scott&#8217;s central theme: &#8220;woman as subject, gender, and politics&#8221; - a terse but loaded phrase. </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="caps">SUBJECT</span>:</div><div>In providing &#8220;herstory&#8221; and providing various perspectives and accounts to women&#8217;s contributions and roles in history - emphasizing their agency in society - Scott asks if these approaches will and can possibly supplement historical records and knowledge without &#8220;rewriting history&#8221; as we know it. </div><div><br /></div><div>I too wonder about the transformation that might happen in our celebration of the past. Here I am reminded of an expression that I have known so long I cannot even remember when and where I learnt it - &#8220;Behind every great man there is an even greater woman.&#8221; Further, this sort of approach not only might rewrite the past but guide the future by promoting female agency through a glorification of the past and further active struggles for greater gender equality. </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="caps">GENDER</span>:</div><div>While most of the world does still live in a binary gender-sex system, this dichotomy has changed some. In our discussion, we noted the differing degrees of acceptable departure from the gendered norms for men and women, with women having greater latitude. Why is this the case? The international community has recognized the need for greater gender equality, both fulfilling ratified international conventions&#8217; clauses of such entitlements as a human right and furthering economic growth (as demonstrated by countless studies). Following this international reform movement granting greater rights to women, women have taken on traditionally &#8220;masculine&#8221; roles and behaviors at an exponential rate, and doing so has become increasingly acceptable. </div><div><br /></div><div>However, the opposite - men taking on traditionally female roles and behaviors - continues to receive overwhelming opposition and ridicule as a general rule. Why this double standard? Why must men be so manly? </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="caps">POLITICS</span>:</div><div>Scott emphasizes how gender and politics interplay and therefore must be analyzed in relation to one another. For example, she highlights how the political defines and infiltrates every aspect of our lives (whether we know it or not): &#8220;Since political structures and political ideas shape and set the boundaries of public discourse and of all aspects of life, even those excluded from participation in politics are defined by them&#8230;. the private sphere is a public creation.&#8221; </div><div><br /></div><div>This particular quotation brought to mind a recent event on campus: We all know and feel that the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is an academic institution situated in a very politically conservative community, and perhaps its social policies have reflected its fear of condemnation from or even connection with the surrounding environment. However, I recently learned that <span class="caps">UTK</span> is decades behind other institutions in its policies and resources directed toward <span class="caps">LGBT</span> people. This year a Resource Center is planned to be opened, but it apparently has insufficient funding to operate fully. It has finally come to the administration&#8217;s attention that faculty and staff should receive &#8220;Safe Zone&#8221; training, which promotes an open and welcoming environment toward <span class="caps">LGBT</span> people and encourages frank and honest discussion. </div><div><br /></div><div>Clearly, the political and cultural climate in the South generally upholds the gender-sex system. However, apparently even among the marginalized and &#8220;non-traditional,&#8221; there are tensions toward those who are outside of their own schemes of normalcy. For example, among the <span class="caps">LGBT</span> community, transsexuals are often considered outsiders who do not belong to any group. Again, the binary conceptions are expressed, though this time from a place one might not expect. </div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5120894936235357930-1086599150470265076?l=ineedalittleskimmilk.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article></div>
