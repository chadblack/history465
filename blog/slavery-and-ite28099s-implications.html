<p> Naturally I assume that, being educated individuals, we were all previously aware of the horrific and morbid nature and practices that the slave trade/industry consisted of.  But a week of studies such as our previous one is important so that we never forget or undermine the incalculable damage and nightmarish pain that such a destructive practice creates.  However, this week was also important in a revealing sense as well.  I had always pictured the slave trade with the assumption that individuality was deterred and discouraged in slaves by slave traders/owners.  That cultural practices and vital elements of culture such as religion and language were repressed and subsequently halted altogether.  All of this was coupled with the general practice of removing notions of original identity and embedding an entirely new one in the minds of the slaves.  But I was unaware of the extent to which the slave industry had thought out this process and how it was reinforced in all manners of forced labor.<br />
    Firstly, and sadly, these people were at the time viewed by most in the same light that modern societies view cars.  Slaves were simply thought of as products and not as people.  The system of slave sales had developed to the point that sellers of slaves sold with the same cautiousness warranted by lemon laws.  For instance, if a slave was prone to attempt an escape or was hindered by any kind of handicap the slave trader would disclose this knowledge to potential buyers for their own protection from lawsuits.  I find this, as well as other “industry techniques” quite appalling and disgusting.  The thought that human beings were forced to endure treatments that made them entirely objective and robbed them of personality or humanity is shocking.<br />
    Many of the labors forced upon slaves reinforce my point that individuality and autonomy of slaves were entirely ignored.  As an example I point to the practice of forced wet nursing among female slaves.  This, to me, ranks among the most horrid tendencies of slave labor for a number of reasons.  Firstly it asserts a level of complete and utter dominance over the slave.  It not only subjects a woman to extremely tender and emotional practice with an infant, but it confirms the thought entirety of a slave belonged to his or her master.  Even their genitals and bodily fluids were viewed as a portion of the owner’s “product.”<br />
    I reiterate, this process and practice scares me immensely.  If slaveholders truly believed that all facets of their slaves were their own private property then when, if ever, would a line be drawn?  Supposing that a slave holder might actually acknowledge that a slave has a soul, which I believe many might have done given their Christian founded justifications for capturing and buying slaves, then would they consider said soul their property as well?  If so, how could it have come into their possession?  Could these Christians truly contend that a soul was purchased by capital?  If not, how could they have even justified their holding of slaves at&nbsp;all?</p>
