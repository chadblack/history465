<div>I must admit I both thoroughly am enjoying the film <i>I, Worst of All</i> and am rather intrigued and confused by many aspects of it, namely the receptiveness of both some Spanish and Mexican clergypersons and political figures. It seems counterintuitive that during that time period Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz would have received such professional and intellectual respect from men within the Church but especially from men outside the Church. I particularly was fascinated by such when it became clear that her piety was both different and lacking. </div>

<div><br /></div>

<div>Living as a poet and scientist more than a nun, Sor Juana certainly epitomized those who entered the monastery on account of the resources available there as opposed to the desire for absolute spiritual service. As those not “fascinated” by her frequently declared, she living a luxurious life as a black veil rather than a life dedicated to God. Sor Juana’s argument that her poetry is her service to God seems rather empty to me - she wrote that poetry for herself, for the intended person, for art and knowledge’s sakes, to build a legacy, etc. but not for the glory of God - or at least it appears to me. While the poems may not have been sacrilegious, it doesn’t seem that her intention was to glorify God through her gift but to glorify herself, which would be ok if she were not posing as a religious person, not to mention a nun (servant of God and bride of Christ). </div>

<div><br /></div>

<div>Her comments about avoiding being chained down to a man as well as her interaction with the Vicereine force me to consider her sexuality. Although I cannot form any definitive opinions until concluding the movie (any reading more about her), it seems to me that Sor Juana may well be in love with the Vicereine - not a blanket lesbian - but in love with her specifically. Sor Juana seems so very opposed to marriage and romantic relationships with men in general, considering them an extensive of the repressive patriarchal system she has attempted to escape her whole life. In the monastery, she found a few nuns with whom she could share her thoughts and dreams but few with whom she could truly relate; however, the Vicereine appealed to Sor Juana with a sense of shared past and present, allowing her sense of isolation and loneliness to lessen. </div>

<div><br /></div>

<div>I was rather confused by the handful of scenes involving Sor Juana and the Vicereine that could have simply demonstrated the depth of their friendship and connection as isolated women or could have been rather sexual - such as her unlacing the Vicereine’s dress/corset and the Vicereine’s telling Sor Juana she was only hers and kissing her. </div>

<div><br /></div>

<div>Essentially, curious as to other’s opinions on this and anxious to see the conclusion. I truly am rather perplexed as to how Sor Juana received such acclaim as a nun both while she was alive and post-mortem; she clearly was very clever and innovative but she does not seem to have in any way have used those talents in the direction of the Church or its furtherance. So why is she such a celebrated nun? </div>
